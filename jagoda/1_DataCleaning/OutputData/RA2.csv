The first contribution hinges upon the estimation of households stock market participation considering both direct participation (direct stock market holding) and indirect
participation (through mutual funds and managed investment). The estimated total stock market participation rates are in line with the ones of others main European countries, but much lower than the British and American ones. The second contribution is the efficiency analysis of households portfolios based on the comparison of observed portfolios with the mean-variance frontier of assets returns. The paper outlines that most of the households? portfolios are extremely close to the efficient frontier only when we explicitly take into
account no short selling constraints, while the null hypothesis of being efficient is rejected for all the portfolios if we do not consider these constraints.

In several cases, however, the leagues won in court, on the ground that sport is not a standard good. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which the sale of TV rights collectively by sports leagues, rather than individually by teams, is preferred from a social welfare point of view. We find that collective sale is socially preferable when leagues are small, relatively homogeneous in terms of clout and where teams get little performance-related revenues.

Relatively few papers have instead investigated the optimal design of IPOs, namely the choice of optimal pricing and rationing rules. This paper belongs to this less popular strand of the IPO literature. In particular, we investigate the characteristics of the optimal IPO, focusing on the allocation and rationing rule, when institutional investors are risk averse. Institutional investors are typically considered regular participants in this kind of market operations and also endowed with private information about the market value of the issue on sale. In this paper we investigate how the optimal IPO would change when we introduce risk aversion on the institutional investors' side while assuming that retail investors are not subject to cash constraints. The question is relevant because in the presence of risk aversion the principal (the selling firm) faces a trade-off between risk insurance and incentives. The objective of the paper is to see how the allocation rule and thus possibly the need for rationing changes in this case. Our results suggest that at the optimum rationing occurs when there is an oversubscription of the issue. In this case, all the shares are allotted to the institutional investors but to an amount smaller than the demanded one. The paper also provides a methodological contribution since we use an optimal auction approach to describe the IPO process. IPOs are a very natural example of an optimal auction design problem because of their peculiar informational structure which exhibits a number of agency problems and because the currently used IPO mechanisms are either auction or auction-like mechanisms.","B",False,,"Bennouri, Moez ",True,,,,
