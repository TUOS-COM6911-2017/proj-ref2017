Most of the book (152 pages) was not previously published. This includes entirely new ethnographic material, whose conceptualisation and analysis represents a new direction: studying people's engagements with objects left behind by members of a community represented as 'enemy,’ conceptualising a postwar environment as constituted through peoples' fraught engagements with materialities, and studying the affects transmitted by the built and natural environment after war. Incorporating masses of new ethnographic material and novel (previously unrepresented) forms of conceptualisation, and with the older material entirely revised and re-analysed, the book is an independent contribution that should be evaluated in its own right."

10002718,24,,3123081,Q,Sounds like a vintage guitar: a documentary about old guitars,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/8084/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"In this film, the vintage electric guitar is approached as a ‘contemporary relic’, a modern musical instrument which is also ‘traditional’. The veneration of the ‘modern past’ extends to the counterfeiting of vintage instruments artfully distressed to replicate instruments which are actually little older than their most devoted collectors.

The transformation of instruments not long ago regarded as exemplars of mass culture into high-end (Sotheby’s, Bonhams) collectables provides an opportunity to chart movements within and between different taste cultures as well as the co-existence of traditions of artisanship and technologically advanced equipment manufacture. Sub-domains of esoteric forms of connoisseurship and taste cultures express international, national, and regional/micro-regional tendencies not part of official histories (of instrument manufacture, for example) or larger narratives of cultural capital.

London’s Denmark Street has long served as a focal point for the popular music industry, first in terms of music publishers and with the pop boom of the 1960s, later as a retailing site and repair centre. Within the Street’s workshops the cultivation of the electric guitar as both a symbol and a working instrument is realized in terms of trendsetting and reaction to external influences (the rise of Eastern production of high quality instruments, for instance). The film, through observation and interviews, focuses on artisans, collectors and sellers for whom an interest in guitars and their history is both livelihood and subject of obsessive interest.

The fabrication of cod-authenticity through faux vintage instruments achieves a replicant virtue: many of the desired instruments are so rare as to make ownership unrealistic (a well-preserved vintage instrument with sound provenance could attract a price of well of £100,000), and as a consequence, the fakery of a faux vintage instrument may be regarded as achievement rather than defect."
10002718,24,,3123082,Q,Waila: the Music of the Tohono O'odham featuring Gertie Lopez and the TO Boyz,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/8083/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"The Tohono O’odham are a people who straddle the US/Mexican border in what is known as the Western Desert. These borderlands include the major crossing points for undocumented Central Americans and Mexicans seeking work in North America, and the Tohono O’odham reservation covers the entry zone between the border and Tucson, the nearest major city.

The Tohono O’odham are one of a number of Southwestern native peoples for whom the term ‘marginality’ carries a depth of meaning. Currently subsidized in large part by their casino operations, the Tohono O’odham, maintain a quiet presence in massively altered desert landscape in which their first settlement (c. 1000 BCE) lies amidst the remains of a basalt mine exploited to build, among other things, the perimeter wall of the University of Arizona.

Waila Music

‘Waila’ is a portrait of a TO woman and musician, Gertrude Lopez, who both exemplifies aspects of modern TO society and challenges it: on one hand she pursues traditional TO musical custom, leading a band which plays the syncretic music waila that binds TO communal celebration and European musical forms, yet simultaneously challenges convention: only men are meant to be bandleaders. Tracking musical performance on the reservation, in a South Tucson bar, in the recreation hall of a Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter and a health education benefit, the film uses Gertie to touch on various aspects of modern TO experience. The film includes interviews with Bernard ‘Bunny’ Fontana, a veteran ethnologist of the TO; Mike Wilson, a TO activist responsible for maintaining water stations on immigrant routes through the reservation; Mark Bahti, an Indian arts and jewelry trader; NEA award-winner, folklorist Jim Griffith."

It asked how vulnerability factors to noise effects are created through social and political relations by describing the daily ‘lived experience’ of one family farm located at the end of the main runway inside Tokyo’s Narita international airport. Methodology The work is based on a collaboration between artistic and scientific practices of listening to and representing sound so as to create an ethnography that is sensory by design. Noise data was converted into forms of description through making sound recordings and shooting film and by creating an immersive gallery installation where this material could be played back through a multi-channel, multi-screen system. The audio-visual design aimed to engage the gallery going public with the ways in which the matter of air as frequency, vibration and intensity becomes an affective geography of political and social relations.Dissemination: The work was exhibited at the Whitworth Art Gallery, as part of the 2011 Asia Triennial; the Ethnographica Terminalia exhibition held as part of the 2012 American Anthropological Association meetings; and the IX Media Art Monographic Show 2013 (Colombia); it was accepted for competition in electronic arts festivals at ISEA 2012 (one of 50 works from 1500 entries) and Bideodromo 2012 (one of 69 works from 467 entries). In November 2013 it will be exhibited at an art-show in the Haus für elektronische Künste Basel and then enter their permanent collection. In Japan in 2013, the work was exhibited in the Narita Cultural Hall and Okinawa museum of art and history and interviews with Cox about this were published in the Mainichi Shinbun Okinawa Times and Ryukyu Shinpo newspapers."

It contains an additional introductory section, a new conceptual discussion of 'emplacement' and a discussion of specifically feminist studies of home and migration.

The issue is made up of 13 single-authored articles, including an article by Alexander, and a substantial introduction co-authored by Alexander and McGregor. Alexander initiated, organised and raised the funding for the workshop on which the special issue was based. It brought together a multi-disciplinary and multinational group of scholars who had undertaken recent, in-depth field research in Zimbabwe, and included both established and young scholars. (For four of the authors their contribution to the special issue was their first publication.) The workshop was held at the Department of International Development in October 2012 and addressed theoretical and substantive debates as well as methodological challenges. The articles as a whole use the dramatic political and economic upheavals in Zimbabwe from 2000 to revisit debates in African studies over three key themes: the character of the post-colonial state, the politics of opposition, and the functioning of patronage-based economies. They offer a critical reassessment of some of the dominant approaches to understanding these phenomena in political science and engage with new methods and theories emerging largely from anthropology and history. The articles are grounded in rich empirical research, attuned to material and normative questions, and insistent on the importance of history. They offer a riposte to prevalent assumptions of, and explanations for, state ‘weakness’ and social and political ‘disorder’ in Africa, and contribute to the development of new approaches. Note that REF output 24B-142 is a paper in this special issue. However, that paper was entirely the original work of Phillan Zamchiya."

Alexander contributed a single-authored article to the collection. The issue began as an international conference in Oxford in April 2010, co-organised by Alexander and Kynoch. All papers were solicited and edited by the co-editors. They make a substantial contribution from across the disciplines but predominantly from history and anthropology to the study of discourses and practices of 'punishment', broadly defined, as they revealed and constructed relations of class, gender and race as well as the contours of citizenship. The papers focus on punishment as enacted by state agencies, employers, liberation movements and popular forces, and trace their shifting claims, purposes and practices across the colonial and post-colonial divide. Drawing on rich empirical research by scholars from Africa, North America and Europe, and using a comparative frame that reaches well beyond southern Africa, the issue explores the roots and legacies of colonial-era practices of discipline and punishment (state and non-state), noting the powerful impact they have had on post-colonial forms of social and political ordering."

Gledhill devised the project and recruited three international scholars (McQuinn, Longley Alley and Ayatollahi Tabaar) as case study contributors. He wrote the introductory article which defines the research questions and sets the theoretical framework used in the case studies of Libya, Yemen and Egypt respectively. Gledhill worked closely with each author in revising their contributions, in order to create consistency in structure and style across each of the three case studies.

She is the sole author of the Introduction, in the first part of which (pp 1-14) she sets out the conceptual framework and problems for analysis that underpin both the book and her own research. Enterprise culture is taken as the analytical lens through which to examine social, cultural and attitudinal change in?neoliberalising India. Enterprise culture is conceived in terms of the creation of autonomous, aspiring, active enterprising selves, and it is explored in the realm of public culture, social practice, and personal lives. From this perspective, the central research question posed in the book (and derived from?Gooptu?s wider research project) is the nature and extent of the spread of enterprise culture in India, its novel qualities and its relation to pre-existing ideas and practices. The book enquires into the myriad manifestations of enterprise culture, differentiated along the lines of class, gender and generation. Three sets of analytical problems are addressed. The first set of chapters (including Chapter 4, solely authored by Gooptu, on new spiritual organisations) examines how various actors and institutions construct dominant ideas about enterprise in public discourse. The second set of chapters (including Chapter 8, co-authored by Gooptu, on housewives and reality TV) analyses how individuals and groups embrace ideas and practices of enterprise with unintended consequences, while the final set of chapters investigates contested and contradictory dimensions of enterprise culture.?Gooptu?s contribution in Chapter 8 is approximately 80 per cent,?which includes?formulating all analytical arguments,?writing the chapter in entirety and doing much of the primary field-research (analysis of TV programmes and focus group discussions with housewives).?"

The theme of the series of lectures was the comparative fate of democracy across African countries, drawing upon the in-depth knowledge of the country specialists. After the lecture series, a one-day conference was held, where the preliminary draft chapters were presented to a wider audience of colleagues and students. The prospective publishers were also invited to that conference. All the processes involved in the lectures and the conference were coordinated by Abdul Raufu Mustapha. The book has 12 chapters which explore the key experiences of democratisation in 11 important countries spread across Africa?s main geopolitical divisions. Each chapter highlights the challenges faced by a specific country. The ten country-specific chapters are framed by an Introduction and a Conclusion which draw out comparative and thematic issues relevant to Africa as a whole. Abdul Raufu Mustapha, apart from having overall editorial responsibility for the volume, also contributed a country chapter on Nigeria and wrote substantive sections of the Introduction and Conclusion."

The research followed a global chain of counterfeit goods through participant observation and interviews (with street vendors in Brazil, Chinese migrants in Paraguay and Chinese entrepreneurs and officials in China). The book problematizes the challenges faced by emergent economies and their development models. Six of the fieldwork-based chapters could be standalone articles for specialist journals.","This book provides an extensive ethnography of the trade in counterfeit goods from Chinese factories to a Brazilian street market through Paraguay.?It is based on an eight-year multi-site ethnography in the three countries (1999?2007).
