During the period of his PhD, we wrote a number of proposals for ground based data for the project together. For the paper, Morris reduced both the HST and ground-based data in parallel with the student to provide an independent check. We worked very closely together on designing the analysis approaches we used (in particular for the absorber-galaxy cross correlation, where the error estimation is challenging). We developed together most of the cross checks for the results.

This paper proposes two novel explanations for this observation: (a) In Section 2.2.1 we show that the shape of the dHvA oscillations can be explained by invoking an inhomogeneity in the number density, of around 2% not previously considered. (b) In Section 2.2.3 we show that if the number density of the 2DES is allowed to oscillate in response to the abrupt jumps in the chemical potential, then this could also account for the observed shape of the dHvA oscillations. This challenges the widely held belief that the number density is fixed and that quantum Hall physics is caused by the oscillating chemical potential. 2) The discussion around Figure 7 is an novel analysis of dHvA data previously published by another group, using our model DOS. The fit to our model is at least as good as the original fit they did to theirs, bringing into question their conclusions, and underlining the need to fit data over a wide range of magnetic field in order to distinguish between different models. 3) Figure 13 shows induced currents for the first time at seven different Landau level filling factors. 4) In Sections 1.1 and 1.2, different designs of magnetometer are analysed for the first time using an objective figure of merit (i.e. the number of effective Bohr magnetons detectable per electron present in the sample) and micromechanical cantilevers are identified as the most sensitive."

For this paper, JAH’s results provided the experimental evidence for the existence of dislocations consistent with those invoked to explain how a loss of Bernal stacking can be accommodated in few-layer graphene.

Specifically section 9 on Freudenthal triples has led to a new symmetry of supergravity known as Freudenthal duality, pursued by Zumino and others (arxiv:1208.0013, 1212.3254). In sections 8.3 to 8.6 on octonions and the Fano plane form the basis of a new approach to string/M-theory based on the four division algebras: real, complex, quaternion and octonions (RCHO) that goes beyond just their utility in black hole physics. For example, this has led to a formulation of N=1,2,4,8 Yang-Mills as a single theory over R, C, H, O. Regarding gravity as the product of two Yang-Mills theories then yields a ’’magic square’’ of supergravities (arxiv:1301.4176). These results go some way to fulfilling the promise of the role of octonions in M-theory discussed in section 15.2 but we believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Other original sections are 13, which explores a more exotic version of the black-hole/qubit correspondence based on the octonionic quantum mechanics of Jordan,Von Neumann and Wigner, and Appendices C and D on the role of E8 in quantum information theory."

10003270,9,,3320426,F,METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LASER PULSE CONTROL,,,,,,,,,,,WO/2013/017338,2013,,1,False,,False,False,,,E,,,False,"This is a patent that was developed as a result of laser research in Prof Damzen’s laboratories in the Photonics Group of the Department of Physics. Prof Damzen’s group had developed and pioneered a novel diode-pumped solid-state laser technology (the “bounce” geometry) that gave high efficiency operation and whose exceptionally high gain allowed Q-switched pulse operation to remarkably high repetition rates (>1 MHz), an order of magnitude higher than that of other existing solid-state lasers. About 40 papers were published on this laser geometry. A problem however was that the exceptionally high gain of this laser prevented Q-switching at low repetition rates because practical intracavity loss modulator devices for Q-switching were unable to “hold-off” the lasing. This is a problem indeed for all high gain lasers.

The inventive step of this patent, developed by the patent authors (Prof Damzen and his PDRA (Dr Shardlow)) was to resolve this problem by placing a secondary laser cavity around the gain medium (laser amplifier) “clamping” the gain of the primary laser cavity and preventing ‘breakthrough’ at low repetition rate operation. The scientific demonstration of this patented technique has been publicly presented: “Laser Pulse Control of a Q-switched Nd:YVO4 Bounce Geometry Laser using a Secondary Cavity”, E. Arbabzadah, P. Shardlow, and M. Damzen, Paper CA-9.6, CLEO-Europe, Munich 2013. The patent has also been applied in the inventor’s (Prof Damzen’s) Spin-Out company, Midaz Lasers Ltd, where it is the key element used in the diode-pumped solid-state laser product (Flair-20) allowing pulse variation from single shot to 800 kHz. The patent was a key part of the Intellectual Property that led to the company’s successful sale to world-premier scientific laser company, Coherent Laser Inc, in 2012, for $3.8M."

This work underpinned the conclusion that the multiple peaks observed in the single-molecule FRET histograms arose from subpopulations of p53 protein conformers (a fundamental discovery).

This paper describes the first ever  detailed and comprehensive measurements of residual strains in both the interior and exterior of adhesive joints. The strain measurements are supported by detailed FE modelling and Moire surface strain measurements. Up until now the values of residual strains caused during manufacture of joints had been calculated or derived by FE modelling but never fully verified. In fact good agreement was found between measured and calculated values which validates current methods and provides industry with greater confidence in the modelling results.

This paper introduces several novel ideas. Section 2.1 presents a possible new parameter set for linear collider ILC, resulting from detailed beam-beam studies, that could reduce its power consumption. Section 2.2 proposes a novel approach to selection of the linear collider parameters to allow for beam energy recovery, which in particular could be performed in suggested dual aperture cryomodules (like LHC magnets) with independent accelerating and decelerating structures. Section 3.2 analyses the challenges of interaction region beam stability and proposes a drastic change to the conceptual design of the linear collider machine detector interface (increasing the L* parameter and placing the final lenses on the stable tunnel floor). Finally, in section 5 the concept of a plasma-acceleration based linear collider is explored, based on beam-beam simulations and other studies necessary to ensure that the parameter set of this collider will be consistent with the design objectives."

We have carried out the non-perturbative renormalisation of
a set of operators.
These coefficients are important components in calculations of
a number of important physical quantities which we reported on in
follow-up publications.

To this end we have introduced a new choice of
kinematics for the external momenta in the momentum-subtraction-scheme
which suppresses residual chiral symmetry breaking effects.

My particular contributions were:
- computation of the matching factors (lattice scheme to MSbar scheme)
- construction of the non-perturbative amputated Greens functions for
  all operators
- numerical data analysis, fitting and error-analysis
- writing parts of the paper"

In 2007 I published a theoretical paper predicting the emission of dynamical Casimir radiation when the light-matter coupling between a two dimensional electron gas and the photonic field of microcavity is modified non-adiabatically (PRL 98, 103602 (2007)). In the present paper we reported the first realisation of such a non-adiabatic modulation. Apart from proposing the theory that motivated the experiment, I performed all the theoretical modeling and the data analysis, needed to ascertain if the modulation was indeed non-adiabatic."

In 2010 I published a theoretical paper predicting the possibility to access an unprecedented ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime in a novel solid state cavity quantum electrodynamics setup (PRB 81, 235303 (2010)).
In the present paper we reported the first experimental realisation of my proposal. Apart from proposing the theory that motivated the experiment, I modeled the experimental setup, fitted the experimental data, and conceived a method to measure the strength of the coupling."

Jackman led the paper, inspired by her discovery the previous year of the first in situ evidence of plasmoids at Saturn, and opening up a whole new field of research at Saturn into the properties of tail reconnection. She found the case study candidates through a detailed survey of the Cassini data, which required a keen eye to select interesting features. She performed the analysis of the magnetometer data, obtained raw from collaborators on other instrument teams, and plotted and analysed those data sets. She wrote all of the text and incorporated comments and suggestions from co-authors."

physical masses. In particular, I extended $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$
chiral perturbation theory with a kaon matter field to describe the
chiral behaviour of the pion decay constant $f_K$ and the neutral kaon
mixing parameter $B_K$ in both partially-quenched and full QCD

I was lead author and main editor. The project started when I attracted Prof Djouadi here via a Leverhulme Visiting Professorship for which I was scientist in charge. I then contacted the main NMSSM experts worldwide, and coordinated the efforts of all the authors. I provided key phenomenological input. I chaired the discussions and arbitrated in the debates and through this led the team through a number of iterations towards the benchmarks which we validated theoretically. I also played a key role in seeing these benchmarks through to the point where they have now been adopted for experimental analysis."
