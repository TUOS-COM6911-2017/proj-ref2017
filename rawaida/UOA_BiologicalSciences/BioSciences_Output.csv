The generation of such an interface between stem cell-derived neurons and muscle, and that it can be used to pace muscle with an artificial control system, is the key idea of the patent application.
 
We first established recombinant mouse ES cell clones that carry a motor neuron specific reporter transgene, Hb9::CD2-GFP, as well as a doxycycline-inducible molecular photosensor, Ch2R(H134R)-YFP. Next, we differentiated these ES cells into motor neurons in embryoid body (EB) cultures, using established protocols. The EBs were then cocultured with embryonic muscle fibres derived from primary mouse satellite cells. Motor axons grew out of the EBs and formed contacts with the muscle fibres which resembled neuromuscular junctions. Furthermore, optical stimulation of the cultures with blue light induced muscle contractions, as measured by displacement of the myofibres.
 
I contributed by planning and performing most of the experiments, with the exception of the primary myofibre dissection (Robert White, Zammit group) and video microscopy of optogenetic stimulation (Juan Burrone). These results support the claim made in the patent application, as they are, to my knowledge, the first demonstration of optogenetic control of myofibres by ES cell-derived motor neurons. 
 
Since then, we (Greensmith and Lieberam groups) have shown that optogenetic control of muscle function works in vivo, but these experiments were performed recently and are not part of the patent application."

This identified a scaffold of RAR alpha from which further chemistry was carried out to obtain the novel lead compounds exemplified in the patent. The Corcoran lab carried out assays on the compounds to identify EC50 and IC50 of the various compounds (approximately 500 compounds were screened). These structural activity relationships were fed back to the chemists who made further compounds and the assays were reiterated until highly selective compounds were obtained as shown in the patent.
In addition the compounds were tested in the Corcoran lab to delineate drug like properties, including cell survival and their ability to cross the blood brain barrier when given orally. 
To show that they were a therapeutic for Alzheimer’s disease eight of the compounds shown in the patent were tested in animal models. Readouts included, Amyloid plaque load (decrease to show the drug working) and behavioural assays (improvement showing the drug working)."

It summarizes and explains the main approaches to age estimation in the living, defining when a parameter may be of use and raising awareness of its limitations. The text is very practise focussed and summarises experience-based approaches from a variety of cultural and jurisdictional perspectives.  The aim of the text is also to ensure that practitioners do not use it as a ‘cook book’ approach but reinforces that they must have a full and realistic appreciation of human variation (at both individual and ethnic ancestral levels) which must be conveyed to the court accurately and appropriately. This text also encourages practitioners to recognise when an assessment is beyond their area of expertise or beyond verification depending upon the clinical data available. Each key approach to age evaluation has been allotted a single chapter, written by an international leader in the particular field and brought together by a strong and highly respected international team."

10007852,5,,3126145,G,OMERO : Open source scientific image data management platform,,Open Microscopy Environment,,,,,,,,,,2012,http://openmicroscopy.org,0,False,,False,False,,,G,,,False,"Despite significant advances in imaging instrumentation and analysis algorithms, major informatics challenges remain unsolved: file formats are proprietary, facilities to store, analyze and query numerical data or analysis results are not routinely available, integration of new algorithms into proprietary packages is difficult at best, and standards for sharing image data and results are lacking. We have developed an open-source software framework to address these limitations called the Open Microscopy Environment (http://openmicroscopy.org). OME has three components—an open data model for biological imaging, standardised file formats and software libraries for data file conversion and software tools for image data management and analysis.
 
The OME Data Model (http://openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/) provides a common specification for scientific image data and has recently been updated to more fully support fluorescence filter sets, the requirement for unique identifiers, screening experiments using multi-well plates.
 
The OME-TIFF file format (http://openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff) and the Bio-Formats file format library (http://openmicroscopy.org/site/products/bio-formats) provide an easy-to-use set of tools for converting data from proprietary file formats. These resources enable access to data by different processing and visualization applications, sharing of data between scientific collaborators and interoperability in third party tools like Fiji/ImageJ.
 
The OMERO platform (http://openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero) includes server and client applications that combine an image metadata database, a binary image data repository and high performance visualization and analysis. The current release of OMERO (OMERO-4.4; http://openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/downloads) can access image data of all types regardless of original file format, via a variety of applications (e.g., ImageJ, Matlab and CellProfiler). Support for large images from digital pathology is included. A permissions system controls access to data within OMERO and enables sharing of data with users in a specific group or even publishing of image data. Using these facilities, OMERO and Bio-Formats run the JCB DataViewer (http://jcb-dataviewer.rupress.org/) and several other institutional image data repositories (e.g., http://odr.stowers.org and http://emdatabank.org/)."

Those sugars could be used to produce biofuel and chemical products more cheaply and efficiently than currently because a greater proportion of sugar can be harvested from the biomass with less energy/chemical pretreatment. The sugars largely come from cellulose in plant cell walls and are protected by lignin, a phenolic polymer that is very difficult to degrade. We used co-expression analysis to identify a gene that had no previously known connection to lignin but whose expression was tightly co-regulated with genes on the biochemical pathway producing lignin. We showed that Arabidopsis knock-out mutants that no longer express this gene make 40% less lignin than wild-type plants. Associated with this, certain phenolic metabolites accumulate at higher than normal levels in the mutants. Despite this, the plants grow well, albeit slightly smaller than wild type. A much higher proportion of sugar could be released from the biomass of the mutant than from wild-type plants with either no, or very mild, pretreatments. Although this work was performed in Arabidopsis, the gene is present in other plants including bioenergy feedstocks such as poplar and Miscanthus. The patent therefore protects the manipulation of this gene in all plants to produce ‘modified plants’. Modification could be achieved by biotechnology (GM, TALENs etc), mutagenesis, or by molecular screening for natural variants. Subsequent work, in collaboration with Wout Boerjan in Gent, showed that the phenolics that accumulate in the mutant are actually lignin precursors and that the gene itself encodes a previously unrecognized enzyme that acts directly on the lignin biosynthesis pathway, leading to revision of the pathway."
