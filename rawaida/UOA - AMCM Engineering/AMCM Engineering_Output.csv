This output describes a formal verification that measured increases in weight bearing during fracture healing are closely related to measured changes in the stiffness of the healing fracture. This suggests that increases in fracture stiffness (and therefore healing) can easily be quantified by the simple measurement of changes in weight-bearing during healing. Non-union and delayed union of fractures are significant clinical problems affecting between 5-10% of all fractures. The measurement procedures are effective in determining whether healing is progressing normally or whether further clinical intervention is necessary.

Since pavement management decisions are based on crack evaluation results, the overestimation of cracks caused by the detection of surface irregularities can cause erroneous prioritization and inefficient utilization of rehabilitation funds. An intelligence-based method, using textural and colour properties of different image regions with an un-supervised learning procedure, was developed to differentiate the edge of a patch repair and cracks from digital images. The simplicity and high accuracy (> 97%) is expected to attract interest from researchers and road authorities."

For example, ITO as a ceramic transparent conductor (160Gpa) on PET supports (4GPa) is easily overstressed by the bending required in roll-to-roll manufacturing, resulting in poor device yields. The mechanical analysis and modeling software developed leads to the practical means of reducing such stresses and has huge impact for the printed electronics industry, in particular flexible OLED manufacture. An important patent (US Patent No. 20110241063A1) has resulted from this work."

It is shown that the coarse-cell, floating grains are depleted of solute and the areas of their accumulation contribute to the negative macrosegregation. The areas of fine-cell grains can be either enriched in solute or be close to the nominal composition. It is suggested that that their composition results from the interplay between thermo-solutal and shrinkage-induced flows.

Previous instruments for measuring powder flow behaviour scientifically were expensive (£50k+), needing great expertise to use and interpret the data.  Cheaper instruments lacked scientific link between measurement results and powder behaviour in-plant.  The authors and the manufacturers perceived need for an instrument that is: 
•	economical, 
•	automated,
•	quick to use, 
•	could be used, and results interpreted, by non-powder-experts, 
•	with sound scientific foundation and objective link to how the powder will flow in a given plant,
for QA on powder raw materials and products, and formulation development.  
Bradley and Berry provided intellectual (scientific and design) input.  Brookfield provided manufacturing and software input.  Cadbury, Kerry Ingredients, United Biscuits and GlaxoSmithKline provided case studies and prototype testing.
Significant scientific research was required to determine (i) the best measurement method to predict powder behaviour in the diverse processes in the operating plants, (ii) optimum test method (annular shear cell, principle known from previous practice), (iii) novel test protocols for most selective, robust, automated data generation and analysis across many powders with multiple dimensions of behaviours, and (iv) develop mechanical arrangements giving necessary accuracy and sensitivity, value engineered for low cost.  Supporting evidence on USB.
The instrument fulfuls the technical goals, selling for £12k; highly successful - 200 in use by 140 companies in 24 countries (user list on USB) in 3 years.  Most users never used powder flowability measurements previously.  Annual sales $2M, but the value of the production protected by use of the instruments is several orders of magnitude higher.

analysis of rotor blades. This simplifies the analysis

This paper addresses this issue. Using typical aerofoil section

by a well-established dynamic stall model, we show that inertial effects lead 
to errors that depend on mass ratio. This simplified aeroelastic model is 
commonly used in industry for the analysis of helicopter and wind turbine

A particular finding is that whereas most papers identify, without explanation, that cavity unsteadiness often corresponds to a high order mode of the standard Rossiter model, the actual excitation mechanism is a Kelvin-Helmhotz instability."

The scaling laws obtained can predict how molecular weight affects polymer surface dynamic, hence is important for polymer adhesion and coatings.

However, generation of millions of (20-80) nm wear particles and release of large numbers of metal ions into the body have limited their use.  This early elastohydrodynamic (EHL) analysis of (MOM) implants for average loads and speeds considered conjunction modelling and shear thinning features of synovial fluid.  Minimum film thicknesses predictions for (MOM) hip joints of (30-50) nm were similar to the mean wear debris size, encouraging further development of the numerical procedures for combined squeeze and entraining motions.  Dominant roles of component diameters and clearances were recognised."

The strength of the paper lies in the fact that it is the first to explain driveline frequency migration as a function of the levels of tyre-road friction. The results of the project have been fully incorporated in JLR’s engineering practice. This success has led JLR to pursue further tyre modelling work with Loughborough, within the £1.7 million PSi project. Following publication, the work was also presented at an invited lecture at the Vehicle Dynamics and Control Seminar at Cambridge University in April 2011."

On cooling after welding, this strain can compensate for or offset thermal contraction strains, and thus mitigate residual stresses. Through control of the filler metal chemistry, it is possible to engineer advantageous residual stress distributions in welds, by achieving a specific martensite-start temperature on cooling after welding."

The Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow is a very promising theoretical approach embedded within commercial CFD codes that addresses both challenges. However KTGF starts from an assumption that the local distribution of velocities is Gaussian and so can be described by a single parameter: granular temperature. This assumption is essentially un-tested under processing conditions. In this work we have developed and applied a technique that can be used under industrial conditions showing that the assumption is legitimate meaning CFD predictions can be tested and rate processes quantified.

This paper was the first to describe a combined process, resulting in mixed multilayer forests of fibre.  Critically, it demonstrated that one form of CNT is transparent to iron catalyst vapour, while the other form adsorbs it very strongly.  As the implications of this finding for issues such as novel catalysts, toxicology and future synthesis strategies are understood and further explored, it is anticipated to have a substantial impact in these areas."

The techniques demonstrated have led to development funding for the commercial CAE package, CADfix (www.cadfix.com). The work was performed within the CRESCENDO FP7 project and has provided the foundation for further funding from Rolls-Royce via the SILOET and GHandI TSB projects. It has also led to funding in the TOICA FP7 project in partnership with Airbus, Siemens, SNECMA and GKN Aerospace."

Correlating these to computer simulations, the surface stress in the die cavity was predicted.  By varying the casting cycle it was demonstrated that the thermal fatigue stresses can be reduced leading to extended die life.  The modified casting cycle has been implemented across the UK factory to reduce the company’s die maintenance costs and is being evaluated in Japan and the USA: David Watson (Ryobi UK)."

These nanomaterials are expected to have low toxicity and they can be used as biodegradable scaffolds for a variety of biomedical applications. This work established new academic links with Blaine A. Pfeifer and Paras N. Prasad, SUNY at Buffalo, US, which led to three more publications, DOI: 10.1002/pola.25016; DOI: 10.1002/adhm.201200094; DOI: 10.1021/mp300666s."
