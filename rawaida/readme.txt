6/11/2017
- Selected two UOAs - UOA 21 (Politics & International Studies) and UOA 11 (Computer Science). Thus, proceed with initial checking of UIA 21 (Politics & International Studies) data. Below are my brief notes on the data after checking and perform initial statistics. (Initial scripts uploaded to Github)
- Total of 20 categories of output submitted by this institutions for this UOA. Top three submission are journal articles (3082), authored book (775), and chapter in book (415).
- Total of 56 universities participated in REF 2014
- Most of papers published date are toward closing date of REF submission date
- Majority of submitted papers are authored by ONE individual
- Found major data quality issues with the submission to proceed with detailed analysis - 99% data is N/A for isInterdisciplinary, 83% data is N/A for Research Group, 100% citedbycount is N/A, and 94% additional info is N/A (Note: total rows in dataset is 4365)

Decision - Not to proceed with this UOA and select another UOAs

Checking data on Computer Science UOA 11

- Total of 16 categories of output submitted by institutions for UOA 11. Top three submissions are journal article (5556), conference contribution (1898) and chapter in book (112). 
- Total of 89 universities participated in REF 2014
- IDEA - to uncover potential correlation by populating data in map format against 4* universities
- Found out top 10 submission of outputs are Edinburgh (401), Oxford (263), UCL (261), Middlesex (212), Imperial (201), Southampton (187), Cambridge (184), Manchester (179), KCL (159) and Bristol (159). (Notes - Sheffield is at ranking 25 with 109 outputs
- IDEA - wish to find out whether there's correlation between number of output submitted to overall stars ranking obtained by institution?
- Pursue the above IDEA by using below data and plot scatterplot between count of output submissted to overall ranking
a) count number of output submission (how many entries in the raw data by each university) - need to merge submission list by universities and the university list
b) stars ranking per universities  - at first decide to do a range of stars for each university - decide NOT to proceed with regards to time
