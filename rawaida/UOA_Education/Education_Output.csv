Using Riding’s Cognitive Style Analysis (CSA) as an analytical tool, the author conducted a quantitative control trial with 118 male higher education students, 60 with dyslexia and 58 without, matched for course studied and academic year. A lecture was presented to participants with and without visual reinforcements and answers to comprehension questions were compared across the two groups to measure the impact of mode of presentation on retention of information, across both dyslexic and non-dyslexic control participants. ANOVA and multiple regression analyses revealed no relationship between lecture scores when presentation mode was matched with the individual’s style category as measured on the verbaliser/ imager dimension of the CSA for either dyslexic or control group. Chapters 2 and 6 of this second edition have been substantially re-written in the light of the author’s further research, with chapter 5 (p.91) making explicit reference to the above study.  The theoretical position of this second edition has thus shifted in the light of new evidence, rendering it significantly different from the first edition."

She used focus group discussions explored the student practitioners’ insights into their role in providing quality practice. The methodology was interpretive, with both deductive and inductive approaches employed to analyse the qualitative, narrative data sets, which were correlated to the literature.  Although data analysis was shared by the authors, the bulk of work was undertaken by Rose and she created the concept of ‘the plural practitioner’.  Once the framework had been compiled, a ‘member check’ was conducted via a questionnaire (analysed using descriptive statistics) which was utilised to validate the framework. This final analysis was undertaken by Rose. The book also drew on a second piece of research, developed by Rose, which underpinned a key theme explored throughout the book in relation to adult roles, namely ‘child and adult initiated activities’.  A different purposive sample was used of 100 experienced early years practitioners who were undertaking the Early Years Practitioner Status (EYPS) qualification. The research design and methodology mirrored the first project and the analytical process followed the same route (recorded focus group discussions to generate reflective discourse and the use of grounded theory, narrative and content analysis to interrogate the data). A review of the findings from this second study is outlined in the book."

IEC elicited and edited significant input from a UK higher education development and practice community that was funded by Jisc. The basic research process that underpinned the development of the specification involved gathering use cases from communities of practice, soliciting candidate data structures that addressed the use cases, direct pilot implementation of the candidate structures, build consensus around those same candidate structures and record the outcome in draft specification documents. 

After the original leaders of the IMS QTI Working Group moved on, we assumed leadership and brought to completion the latest version, 2.1. IEC, through Kraan, was formally one of three IMS working group co-chairs, but quickly became the editor of the specification. That meant that IEC assumed the chairing of the weekly working group calls, controlled development of the specification through the issue tracker that was central to the research and development process and wrote the changes into a master copy of the document set. IEC was also instrumental in liaising between the various companies and communities across Europe, North America, Asia and the Pacific who have a stake in the specification. IEC also contributed and tested several new data structures, and applied our experience of holding interoperability testing events by organising the first public demonstrations of QTI 2.1 interoperability.

In our recent survey, QTI 2.1 was found to be an integral part of more than a quarter of a billion pounds’ worth of assessment system investment worldwide. There is also evidence that most major US educational publishers and assessment boards have switched to QTI 2.1. as their internal exchange format for assessment material."

Both the idea of using a formal global-as-view model as well as the decision to use the W3C semantic web technology standards were IEC’s contribution, through the work of Kraan. The impetus for the strict global-as-view model arose from IEC’s earlier research on interoperability specifications in general, and our experience with profiling specifications in particular. The danger of trying to make a specification that abstracts over many existing specifications is that it simply ends up adding yet another specification. Limiting RAMLET to the semantics of existing specifications, and only defining the relations between them, solved that problem. This approach could well be applicable to other interoperability specification areas. 

Using our research expertise in semantic web technologies gave the RAMLET group the required formal precision to express the model, as well as the flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of content aggregation specifications to map to and from. IEC was the author and editor of the OWL ontology that represents the RAMLET model. IEC also provided proof-of-concept implementation research."

By using the practice, any technique that maps Atom to RAMLET becomes predictable.

Both the idea of including the Atom syndication format as well as the mapping work itself were contributions from IEC. Atom is slightly unusual for a content aggregation format in that it is not primarily used for static compressed content archives. Nonetheless, IEC’s research into digital repository interoperability, Open Educational Resource (OER) sharing practices and system integration in further and higher education institutions suggested that Atom was used widely to create and share educational content aggregations. In practice, the mapping to the RAMLET core ontology confirmed a high degree of overlap with other content aggregation formats.

In addition to the Atom format, IEC also contributed the IMS Content Packaging mapping to the IEEE RAMLET set of recommended practices, and provided help in the realisation of the remaining formats. IEC made a strong contribution to the development of IMS Content Packaging prior to this REF period."

The result is a text that has been hailed as representing its material in a way that is accessible to students while also thought-provoking to experienced scholars.  The subject matter is the social development of children and how models not just from psychology but from across a range of biological and social sciences contribute to understanding it.

Research questions
What, explicitly, is the current state of understanding in developmental psychology of children as social persons?  
What contribution does Bronfenbrenner’s account of children’s development through social contexts make to integrating disparate theoretical approaches?  
How does understanding based on one disciplinary approach become modified by evidence from other disciplines?

Methodology
The principal method of data collection was extensive critical reading.  Online databases (for example MIMAS’ Web of Knowledge) were searched using key terms and key authors, and journals which appeared frequently in these searches were read systematically.  The criteria applied for inclusion of found items included theoretical importance, quality of the research, interdisciplinary relevance, links to other items and importance for practice, especially in education.

The resulting text appears to provide a robust structure through which to represent children’s social development, and both a critical overview of a broad area and precise referencing to sources.

Means of dissemination
The book sought to present both the research base and the relevant theory with the challenges that face teachers, parents and professional psychologists in mind.  It was published by a major international psychology publisher and marketed to researchers, lecturers and students in developmental psychology and associated disciplines."

This innovative paper, developed with long-term collaborator Coles, was described by reviewers as changing the landscape and practices in mathematics teacher development and forms part of a collection of our papers that look at how concepts in the teaching and learning of mathematics are seen and enacted through this worldview.
Research questions
What principles inform the practice of supporting teacher development through collaborative groups which include both novices and experts? 
What norms for discussion are developed in such a collaborative group?
Methodology
Interrogation of current practice in mathematics education teaching, both pre-service and in-service, at the University of Bristol to distil principles that underpin the effective practices commented on by external examiners.
A collaborative group, funded by the NCETM and focused on the work of Caleb Gattegno had audio-recordings taken of all meetings. A key methodological strategy was to report on a conversation (between the novices identifying common influences in how they had learnt) at the end of the project, then tracking back through the data to see how this happened.
Analysis
For the common experiences, we track back in the data to look for patterns over time. The focus here is on – finding a purpose, using purposes and acting from a purpose, which novices and experts were all able to do.
Means of dissemination
Dissemination is through our practice of teacher education, using collaborative groups for Masters and PGCE work, and, most recently, a collaborative group of PhD students. We wrote a paper that was accepted for the prestigious Task Design ICMI 22 study, which shares and extends these principles."

Research questions
Where do regularities and tensions between teachers’ and learners’ discourse and actions appear in establishing and completing lesson tasks?
How is agency (control of learning) distributed in successful task process?
How might we account for disturbances and counter-activity in task process?

Methodology
Data were collected by video, fieldnote observation and post-observation discussion with teachers of the video record. The affordances and constraints of video recording within lessons are considered, as is the shifting engagement of a practitioner-researcher who intervenes in teaching for professional development purposes. Research literature in the field of cultural-historical activity theory is reviewed, specifically with regard for the definition and critique of the concept of ‘activity system’ (Cole and Engeström, 1992). The concept of ‘counteraction’ (Poddiakov, 2001) is appropriated and extended in order to explain tensions between learner’s activity and teacher’s activity. Broadly, the sociocultural method of observing mediation closely and accounting for developmental change is maintained (Vygotsky, 1986; Wertsch, 1991). 

Means of dissemination
Early reflections on developing teaching competence were shared with teachers on the research site over three years (2004-2006) and in researcher’s initial teacher training work until 2011. A draft of the paper was presented at international conference (International Society for Cultural Activity Research, University of Seville, 2005). A summary of findings was presented and discussed at the UK and Ireland regional meeting of ISCAR at Bath University, 2009. Further investigation of counteraction is ongoing and a subsequent paper was presented at ISCAR Conference in Rome, 2011."

This focused on Globalisation, Education and Development: Ideas, actors and dynamics.

Research questions
To examine the relationship between globalisation, education and development based upon a review of policies and programmes developed at supranational level (global and regional) that have implications for meeting the Millenium Development Goals in Africa and other low income regions; to review the literature on current policies intended to alleviate deepening poverty and inequality of access to infrastructures and public services.

Methodology
The elaborated review methodology developed for the project is called CoSCAr, i.e. the review was Comprehensive (brought together literature in different languages, genres, methodological and theoretical paradigms and grey literature); Systematic (synthesised literature in relation to key themes),  Critical (sought to make explicit and examine the rigour of underlying theoretical and methodological assumptions); and, Accessible (presented in a variety of different formats for different audiences).

Means of dissemination
The published version of the final report was complemented by working papers, policy briefings, journal articles and book chapters on specific aspects of the project - in this case the impact of the new regionalism on education in Africa. The chapter drew on theory of new regionalism developed within international relations which was used to frame discussion of the development of educational regions in Africa. The chapter contributed to a collection of essays on the topic of South-South collaboration in education."

Research questions
To develop new knowledge and understanding to assist policy makers, practitioners and the international development community to implement new initiatives to improve the quality of education for disadvantaged groups of learners in difficult delivery contexts.

Methodology
The EdQual research programme consortium was led by the University of Bristol and included partners in the Universities of Bath, Cape Coast (Ghana), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Witwatersrand (South Africa), de la Frontera (Chile), Aga Khan (Pakistan) and the Kigali Institute of Education (Rwanda). The programme adopted mixed methods to develop a holistic understanding of education quality. It undertook secondary analysis of the Southern African Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ) data set to develop multi-level statistical models of education quality. This was complemented by intervention studies including participant action research in the areas of language and literacy, school leadership, science and mathematics curriculum change and the use of ICTs in education. The EdQual consortium built capacity in partner organisations through collaborative working arrangements and through sponsoring PhDs in areas related to the research.

Means of dissemination
The findings from EdQual were published in numerous working papers, journal articles, conference proceedings and in an edited book. This was an introductory article to a special edition of the International Journal of Educational Development that drew together key findings from the research programme and sought to frame them within a social justice and human capabilities approach."

Enactivism has been referred to as a paradigm-shifting worldview. This paper forms part of a collection of papers, developed by Laurinda Brown and Alf Coles out of a longitudinal collaboration since 1995, that look at how concepts are seen and enacted through this worldview. The paper advances theory by taking a critical look at reflection from the other side of a paradigm shift.
Research questions
From an enactive approach to cognition, we work on the question “how do we do reflecting?”
Methodology
Linking theory and practice is at the heart of enactivist thinking since all learning is seen as doing. We look at the practice of teacher education and individual teachers who have developed as teachers through this practice. We work with student teachers and teachers so that they stay with the detail of their experience. We use transcripts, writing from the teachers about issues in their teaching and field-notes.
Analysis
We analyse the data through the framework of Varela’s concept of “deliberate analysis”. Given the enactivist stance, integrity, coherence and consistency are evidenced through the braiding of first and third-person accounts.
Means of dissemination
Responding to invitations to work with staff and students at the University of Agder, Norway (October 2012) and Monash University, Australia (August, 2012) on enactivist ideas in relation to the teaching and learning of mathematics. There is an entry in the on-line Springer Encyclopedia of Mathematics Education entitled Enactivist Theories. In this writing, my work is identified as being influential, including reference to this ESM paper. Mainly, though, our dissemination is through our developing practice with pre- and in-service teachers of mathematics."

The book is a report of an ESRC funded study, which adopted an enactivist methodology. What this means in practice is that the aim of research is to uncover theories that are 'good enough for' their users. Multiple views of data are taken and there is a cycling process of data collection and analysis. Video recordings were taken of the lessons of one exceptional teacher in one innovative mathematics department in the UK, over a two year period. These recordings were analysed to answer the first research question. There were two cycles of analysis, the first looking at patterns in the use of words, the second looking in more detail at the role of the teacher. These video recordings were also used by me (I was head of the department at the time) in department meetings with staff at the same school. Audio recordings were taken of these sessions and they were analysed to answer the second research question, again, there were two cycles of analysis.

In terms of dissemination, articles taken from this book have appeared in two journals (Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education, For the Learning of Mathematics) and a third article is in preparation for the journal ZDM. I presented the key ideas from the book at a session during the day conference of the British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics (March, 2013)."

Research questions
How can ethical review be undertaken for social science research in ways that support knowledge generation across the full range of applicable research methodologies? 
What are the obstacles to and opportunities for achieving reviews that enhance ethical practice? 
What conceptual framework helps to explain the current mixed experiences of social scientists?
What strategies have been adopted at the selected university to counteract adverse effects and promote positive ethical engagement by social science researchers?

This article is a response to Zachary Schrag’s rebuttal of  ‘ethics review in social sciences’ and his challenge that ‘the burden of proof for its continuation rests on its defenders’ (Schrag, 2011).

Methodology
There are three strands involved gathering and analysing the material that underpins this article:
•	Critical reflection on the implementation of policy and practice – critically reflective practice - analysis of 'warrant'
•	The latest developments in ethics that approach ethical practice as social constructs and cultural tools. The analysis was informed by dialogue with research-active academics during policy consultations and by formal and informal interviews with researchers during their preparation for ethical review
•	‘Writing as research’ within qualitative inquiry and inspired by the ethicist, Robert J. Nash  (2004) Liberating Scholarly Writing. 

Means of dissemination
The dialogical testing of ideas in this article required dissemination prior to publication at university workshops, and a public lecture Research Ethics: one size fits all? This process has continued at events organised by the University Research Enterprise and Development, at the University of Malta, and most recently at the Welsh Senior Research Leaders Programme run by the Leadership Foundation for the Welsh government and HEFCW."

This is the first text to take a systematic overview of legal and ethical issues for this profession. 
The law is viewed as a form of authoritative public ethical discourse designed to structure and regulate human activity but not necessarily coherently nor free of uncertainty, ambiguity and ethical dilemmas.
Research questions
-What are the current opinions and legal/ethical issues that most concern counsellors about these topics?
- What is the applicable law – where this can be established?
Methodology 
1.Quotations from practitioners at the start of chapters have been systematically selected to represent the range of professional views expressed in 2. 
2.A series of ten workshops and consultations were held over the preceding three years in the four countries of the UK to capture the current ethical and legal issues facing practitioners. Some issues were followed up by interviews, email exchanges and other communications.
3.A quantitative analysis was undertaken of issues raised with the relevant professional help line.
4.Legal analysis, mainly based on original sources of law, was the main strategy for establishing the applicable law using forensic reasoning and to identify areas of uncertainty or conflicting views.
5.The organisation of the text was based on a thematic analysis of 1-4.
The lead author (Bond) was responsible for about 70% of analysis and writing drawing over 15 years of researching these topics and related professional practice and consultancy.

The chapter draws on an 18 month research project that explored how one organization, the flagship English ‘creative learning’ programme Creative Partnerships (CP) (2002-2011), attempted to ‘put young people at the heart’ of its work. The chapter provides an overview of the literature and presents some of the findings of the research undertaken. 

Research questions
What is the ‘participatory turn’ in relation to young people in schools and how has it been enacted in different contexts?
What are the benefits for schools in adopting creative approaches to participation?
What kinds of processes and practices of youth participation emerge in creative activities?

Methodology
Data collection:
Interviews (with CP personnel, staff in schools, creative agents or practitioners and students) – transcripts were produced
Observations in schools and at events, focus groups and ‘shadowing’ students, in twelve CP regions – ethnographic fieldnotes were produced
Collection of documentary evidence including eg photographs, minutes, schools’ & CP reports, publications, evaluations, multi-media productions, school application forms.

Analysis involved textual analysis, using established methods from cultural studies, of a large amount of documentary evidence. In addition, interview transcripts and fieldnotes were coded and patterns across the data in reference to ‘youth participation’ pulled out. A taxonomy of youth participation in CP was produced to assist with data analysis.

Means of dissemination
The book was written as a resource for teachers to help them to run participatory arts activities in their schools. The book has been sold nationally and internationally to academics working in the field and to teachers and creative practitioners working in schools.  The work was also presented at national and international practitioner and academic conferences."

Drawing on socio-cultural theories of learning, the project’s overall aim was to examine the ways in which ICT could be used in educational settings to enhance teaching and learning. 

Overview
Marina Gall made a substantial contribution to teamwork on ‘creative designs for learning’, as reflected in this chapter.  The work:
•	explored ways in which technology can liberate and constrain learning;
•	explored issues surrounding teachers’ consideration of freedom and constraints within classroom settings;
•	compared classroom work within three secondary school subject areas - music, modern foreign languages and geography - in relation to ‘liberating contraints’ (Davis, Sumara & Luce-Keplar, 2000).

Methodology
The project was organised around partnerships between researchers and teachers. It centred around  the design  and evaluation of longitudinal teaching and learning initiatives known as ‘Subject Design Initiatives’(SDI): short units of work, created by individuals or pairs of teachers (from a single school) within one specific subject area, together with university teacher- educator researchers. 

Data was collected in the form of:
•	interviews with teachers and students prior to and after each SDI;
•	digital video of classroom interaction; 
•	digital video capture of students’ work;
•	field notes collected during lessons;
•	researcher notes of discussions with teachers during teacher/researcher evaluations of lessons (watching video data);

Dissemination
The project as a whole was disseminated widely to policy makers (e.g. DfES), practitioners  (e.g. National Teacher Research Panel ) and researchers (e.g. invited paper at ‘Media and New Technology in Music Education’ conference, Lulea University of Technology). A research briefing was produced (http://www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/Sutherland_RB_19.pdf) and the research was also disseminated through Teacher’s TV and the TLRP video Principles into Practice (http://www.tlrp.org/pub/videopip.html)."

This academic essay is located within an extended study of ethical maturity to support difficult life and work decisions. Ethical maturity is not viewed as a developmental state that once achieved can be secured for all circumstances. Instead, ethical maturity is defined as a state marked by a number of characteristics and qualities. This chapter is the penultimate chapter and seeks to open up the readers’ awareness of the variability and complexity of factors involved in research ethics.
Key questions:
The essay is shaped around answering:
•How has our current understanding of research ethics been shaped by past ethical crises in undertaking research?
•What ethical warrants, i.e. claims to moral authority, have shaped different approaches to research ethics?
•How do approaches to key issues vary internationally?
•What sort of judgements might be required of an ethically mature researcher beyond the standardised ethical reviews and procedural practices developed for biomedical and experimental laboratory-based research? 
Methodologies:
•	Historical case studies, often based on extensive study of original sources but cited with examples from reliable and accessible sources
•Ethnographic analysis and reflection to prompt and support analysis of differentiating issues and establish the human context of research in social sciences
•Analytically-based synthesis around key themes and to provide a structure for the argumentation underpinning the essay – methodologically originating in philosophical and theological systematics but repositioned as epistemologically socially constructive and secular
Modes of dissemination:
•Locally – ideas tested and disseminated in seminars, lectures and in discussions with researchers in my role as Faculty Research Ethics Officer for Law and Social Sciences
•Nationally – at the Academy for Social Sciences ‘Generic Ethics Principles for Social Science Research’ 
•Internationally – Visiting Professor University for Malta and conferences"

This began with TLRP’s conferences and thematic activities, and was represented for public engagement through ‘evidence-informed principles’.  This specific research addressed the tacit nature of much teacher knowledge, and sought to harvest, synthesise and re-present the conceptual language of expert teachers.

Research questions
What, explicitly, are the most powerful pedagogic concepts on which expert teachers draw?
Is it possible to represent and promote teacher expertise for a 21st century future through the identification of such concepts?

Methodology
There were two parallel strands of data collection.
•	Research literature on teacher discourse, conceptualisation and classroom practice was reviewed. Complementing this during 2008-10, ethnographic methods recorded pedagogic representations at academic seminars and conferences, including BERA, EERA, APERA and AERA.  
•	Practising teachers were extensively consulted.  In particular, a programme of teacher workshops, organised by GTC-E, explored the research questions through discussion and analysis of teacher-led case-studies of routine classroom practice. This work was also discussed at meetings of GTC-NI, GTC-S and at an international conference of GTCs convened by GTC-W.

Analysis was challenging because of the volume and diversity of concepts produced. However, terms with particular relevance to curriculum, pedagogy and assessment were distinguished, and patterns of use were identified in relation to aims, context, processes and outcomes.  The resulting matrix appears to provide a robust structure through which to represent teacher expertise, irrespective of the particular concepts promoted.

Means of dissemination
The TLRP Commentary sought to present both the research base and knowledge of experienced teachers with contemporary challenges in mind.  40,000 copies were printed and distributed to UK schools and HEIs.  The GTCs featured the work in their magazines for teachers and it underpins future-orientated, professional textbooks on Reflective Teaching for early, school, further and higher education."

Despite the importance of online spaces to the lives of young people, digitally-based methodologies are still seen as problematic within wider mainstream educational research. The chapter uses original examples from a 6-year ethnographic study of an online gaming world. It explores some of the methodological and ethical tensions of working in digital space, and provides insights not only into how technological spaces might be conceived, but also how research within such arenas might be approached. 

In terms of originality, significance and rigour, the chapter extends previous research on virtual ethnography (e.g. Beer, 2007; Hine, 2005; Murthy, 2011) arguing that in research terms, digital and material spaces share similar characteristics. Using the case study as the ground for a methodological argument, the chapter suggests that many of the methodological anxieties around virtual methods could be avoided by drawing parallels with existing—and more accepted—material research practices. Despite nearly 15 years of scrutiny by a range of disciplines, there is still a paucity of academic writing that addresses methodological issues in researching digital spaces from the point of view of the education researcher. The chapter therefore makes a methodological contribution to the development of educational research in digital spaces.

The focus of the research was young children’s use of drawing for designing technological artefacts and this required the analysis of a wide range of contexts in which children learn to design and make functional products. The centrality of modelling of ideas, whether through drawing, discussion or mock-ups, was a central tenet of the author’s thesis, which is reflected throughout the book. This research involved an examination of design drawings made by over 300 children aged 4-9 years, leading to a 2-year longitudinal comparative study of two Year 2 classes in a primary school in Kent, to ascertain improvements in designing through introducing a pedagogy based on the findings of the large-scale survey. Further details of the research process are discussed in the author’s output 3, ‘Taking ideas on a journey: researching designing in a Kent primary school.’"

However, while each individual – pupil and student – has to deal with his/her beliefs and desires, only universities remain reliable for ensuring cultural renewal. This chapter aims at critically analysing Rorty’s philosophical positions in two different parts. First, it considers the main assumptions and inheritances of this pragmatism towards classical philosophies. Second, it investigates his understanding of ""liberal hope"" that should facilitate the decrease of cruelty as well as the development of human solidarity.",,,,False,

It argues that the benefits of providing this level of support and establishing relationships built on trust are highly significant and discusses the importance of effective mentoring, informal relationships and friendships, referencing previous research exploring the importance of mentoring for developing resilience and self-efficacy."

Sidorenko proposes that an examination of developmental and psychological issues of learners need to inform sociological analyses in order to avoid reductivism of structuralist and post-structuralist accounts of inequality and to develop a nuanced complex approach based on both social and psychological methodologies.

As noted in the acknowledgements, parts of this book draw on work that was originally published in academic journals prior to 2008, but this material has been substantially developed and reworked, and combined with new material, a) to construct an entirely new argument about the importance of recognizing and celebrating the normative dimension of the sociology of education, and b) to strengthen and extend arguments developed in previous work for a more ethically reflexive and policy-oriented sociology. In total, the previously published material comprises approximately 15% of the book, with the other 85% comprised of wholly new material.

To consider how we can improve vocational education for 14-19 year olds and thereby promote successful progression into the labour market and into higher level education and training routes.

The research for the review addressed a series of questions detailed in the report which underlie the policy recommendations. As part of the review, a formal public consultation was carried out. This centred on a number of the research questions and respondents were asked for relevant empirical evidence and publications as well as analysis and recommendations.  A series of meetings were held with experts in the field, including though not confined to leading academics in the vocational education and training field. These also addressed the research questions.  Study visits were paid to Denmark and France and additional statistical and financial data obtained from relevant ministries. 

The methods by which the research questions were addressed were 
•	A systematic search of government department databases and reports to identify relevant documents from 1985 onwards, including programme evaluations
•	A systematic search of national and international databases for relevant policy literature, curriculum documents, evaluations and peer-reviewed articles
•	Analysis of outputs of consultations and study visits, including both direct responses and identified material/data
•	Statistical analysis of major datasets, including Labour Force Survey, British Household Panel Survey, National Child Development Study, Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, Youth Cohort Study
•	Statistical analysis of government administrative data, including data on funding, qualifications, apprenticeship starts, made available by DfE, YPLA , NAS, UKCES

All material and statistical analyses were reviewed for accuracy prior to publication by government statistical analysts and selected expert reviewers.  Following publication, the research was presented to expert academic audiences, parliamentary committees and national conferences."

10003645,25,,3294384,N,Is the UK an outlier? : An international comparison of upper secondary mathematics education,,The Nuffield Foundation,,,,,,,,,,2010,,3,False,,False,False,,,D,,,False,"This research report addresses a set of research questions that are listed in the report. The report is based on an analysis of evidence in 24 country profiles, published as a separate addendum: Hodgen, J. et al. (2010). An international comparison of upper secondary mathematics education: 24 country profiles. London: The Nuffield Foundation, available at: http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/Country_profiles_outlier_NuffieldFoundation18_04_11.pdf
The method, described in detail in the addendum, was as follows. The research team conducted a systematic online search to identify policy literature, national data and curricula documents. This search used international databases (e.g., INCA, Eurydice) together with Ministry of Education websites and those of associated arms-length technical bodies. The search focused on identifying English-language sources, although some translation was carried out where either curricular documents or participation data were not available in English. Country profiles were drafted addressing the study’s research questions, including information on participation rates. For each country, a national contact was identified with detailed knowledge of policy and practice in mathematics education. Their role was to check and comment on this information, and to provide any important supplementary information or sources of evidence. Following several iterations, final country profiles were validated by the national contacts. 
Prior to publication, the report was blind peer-reviewed by academics chosen by the funders, The Nuffield Foundation. The research was funded following competitive tendering. Dissemination included invited seminars, media coverage, a ministerial meeting and briefings for key policy-makers. The report has been cited as the key evidence in 4 influential reports on post-16 mathematics (e.g., Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education, The Conservative Party’s Mathematics Taskforce) and 6 ministerial speeches on mathematics education indicating a change in government policy towards ensuring “that within a decade the vast majority of pupils [should be] studying maths right through to the age of 18” (Michael Gove, 29/6/2011)."

This report is a review and synthesis of the mathematics education literature relating to countries that attained highly on the mathematics strand of TIMSS 2003. The literature was identified by electronic searches of online databases (e.g., Web of Science, MathEduc) together with web searches of the ‘grey’ literature not published in peer-reviewed journals (via search engines and Ministry of Education and related websites). Initially, 1600 items were identified as potentially relevant, and graded (1, 2 or 3) on the basis of relevance and methodological rigour, using criteria drawn from Slavin (1986) and Meade (2000). A total of 550 items were graded 1. These items were categorised in two ways: (i) by country and (ii) using a set of nested layers that we developed during the scoping exercise. The “top-level” layers were as follows: National / Societal, Schooling System, Curriculum Support, Classroom Practices, Pupils. Within each of these layers, nested sub-layers were identified. In Curriculum support, for example, these sub-layers included Instruction manuals, Advisory/inspection systems, Textbooks, ICT, and Pedagogy/didactics. During the process of analysis and synthesis of the literature, national experts in mathematics education were asked to comment on any surprising or unexpected claims in order to place these in the wider socio-cultural context.
Prior to publication, the report was blind peer-reviewed by academics with expertise in comparative education chosen by the Nuffield Foundation, who funded the study. The research was funded following a competitive tendering process. 
Dissemination included three invited seminars for policy-makers, dissemination through the National Centre for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics, several seminars for teachers, advisers and the Joint Mathematical Council, a Ministerial Round Table (Nick Gibb, then Schools Minister, 2010), and invited advice to the Department for Education and to the National Curriculum Review / writing team."

Parts of the findings have been presented at two conferences: Congress of European Research in Mathematics Education 6 (Lyon, 2009), 33rd Conference of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education (Thessaloniki, 2009).The significance of this research complies with a broader international interest in designing developmentally appropriate activities and inserting Probabilities and Statistics as a core theme in Early Years Mathematics Curricula."

The chapter’s significance lies in how it gets to the heart of pedagogy by its focus on encounter and relationship and in its guarding against the misuse of power by teachers.  In probing the dynamics of the educational encounter between teachers and students, the chapter does four things: (i) it draws upon the author’s forty-plus years of professional teaching experience in multiple settings and with diverse age groups; (ii) it provides philosophical analysis of inappropriate conceptualisations of how education and religious faith may be related in classrooms; (iii) it develops an original deployment of the metaphor of dance for bringing to light central features of the relationship between teachers and students in the context of educating people in matters of faith and (iv) it brings this deployment of the dance metaphor into dialogue with the work of some recent French philosophers of education."

It rigorously exposes the assumptions that are work in the neuralgic relationship between advocates of a legitimate role for religious faith in education and those who view such faith as toxic.

This article explores the relevance for contemporary universities, especially Catholic universities, of a central key feature of Newman’s teaching about university education, the need for interconnectedness rather than fragmentation in the curriculum.  It relates this to the wider, and life-long, human task of personal integration.  Then in an original re-visiting of Newman’s advocacy of interconnectedness and integration as a task for university education, it identifies five challenges to this vision arising from features of the contemporary university context before proposing ways that each of these challenges might begin to be addressed.  In the process it offers a significant and original critical retrieval of the educational thought of Newman, a realistic diagnosis of key features of universities today that inhibit the implementation of his vision and a way to support students (and scholars) in addressing an educational priority that has existential significance both within and beyond the  university."

It draws upon and integrates in an original manner theological, educational, philosophical and sociological perspectives in analysing an aspect of educational work and organisations that is rarely examined explicitly in the literature: the challenge of doing justice to the individuals who make up an educational community at the same time as acknowledging the needs of the institution as an institution.  It poses, in an unusual way, the dialectic between, on the one hand, legitimate zones of jurisdiction within an educational institution, where boundaries, structures, order and direction play a necessary part, and, on the other hand, the need for room for manoeuvre, spaces for freedom, experiment, ownership and personal appropriation by individual staff and students.  Here political realities and personal needs can be in tension.  The chapter brings out how the poles of this tension must be held together creatively and harmoniously, neglecting neither the (diverse) needs of individuals nor the needs of institutions, in service of their educational and religious mission, to provide continuity, consistency, direction and coherence.  The mutual dependence of individuals and institutions is brought out and a strong case is made that authority in educational institutions should aim to promote freedom.  The analysis is applied to the particular context of Catholic schools."

The originality of the work is that this examination moves the analysis of this decline away from the standard arguments of the dearth of technical and scientist education. The monograph is based upon extensive and rigorous research of original sources especially those related to the series of International Exhibitions held between 1851 and 1900. This analysis, the first of its kind, revealed a cycle of exhibition, investigation and legislation associated the ‘technical education ‘issue. The research then adds to this vista of literature by revealing that a much more ‘complicated story’ exists than first thought and provides research which undermines the ‘doom laden’ prophecy commonly attributed in the literature as the causation of Britain’s economic decline. The book was reviewed by a leading academic in the History of Education who described it, ‘as rare and valuable study adding to the growing literature on international exhibitions, the nation state and modernity’"

The chapter argues that this reframing of traditional hierarchies brings forth ethical dilemmas and questions related to privacy, and ownership and control of net-generated data, ideas, and information. This reframing of the field of study is interesting as it focuses a new lens on extant issues so revealing the implications of social media and their use in learning and teaching in higher education."

The team led by Wenger was charged with developing a framework for assessing the learning effects of these networks. The team developed a unique methodology based on a rigorous integration of quantitative and qualitative data. The methodology connects learning activities with learning outcomes by combining indicators characteristic of five 'cycles' of value creation with a well-specified genre of narrative (called value-creation stories) that reveals causal relations between indicators at each cycle. This new methodology is currently being used by researchers in the Netherlands and in the US to assess large national projects connecting educators through networked approaches to professional development."

The 10 volume award-winning encyclopedia represents a full revision and update of the field. The volume focuses on the political dimensions of language policy. The chapter is inter-disciplinary in perspective incorporating economics, politics, sociology of language, and language policy planning. Using a deconstructionist, critical discourse analysis (CDA) methodological approach, the chapter engages with the specific historical processes that have led to the hierarchizing of majority and minority languages and their speakers. The uniqueness of the chapter lies in the fact that in addition to language issues related to migrant and immigrant groups it extends the discourse on language and politics to the largely over-looked autochthonous languages of Scotland, Wales and Ireland, changes taking place within the European Union as well as the complex linguistic demands of the global economy. The main thesis of the chapter is that cultural and linguistic landscapes are not static; they evolve as societies undergo political, economic and demographic changes. Emphasizing the primacy of linguistic capital (Bourdieu) it explains the central role of language as both vehicle and mediator of contemporary social change and the central role that educational processes play in building effective human capital in a continuously changing world. It argues for the need of continued and deepening language in education research into limits and possibilities associated with contemporary change global processes."

Its theoretical framework is provided by postcolonial theory within a postmodernist analytical framework taking account of historical disjunctures, ambiguities and continuities in postcolonial policy discourse . It also considers their impact on national policy frameworks and the implications for social and economic development during a period of globalization and shifts within the labour process, the emergence of new economic markets and changed labour market needs. The study is underpinned by Bourdieu’s concept of linguistic capital exchange within linguistic markets and is extended to evaluate the validity of the notion of ‘language capital’ in local and international ‘language’ markets. Methodologically it is a conceptual-theoretical study based on critical discourse analysis derived from Foucault’s theory on power/discourse, framed by Bakhtin’s concept of heteroglossia, interpreted here within a sociological framework. The focus is on addressing a concrete social problem: the impact of language policy choices on under-development throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. The study is macro-level, using an inter-disciplinary framework to analyse the complex ways in which languages interact with everyday life, economic development and opportunities. The complex language ecologies of countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa are considered and the emergence of indigenous language markets and their economic potential in cross-border trade.  The study examines the creole Langala and the evolution of the sub-cultural code ‘Sheng’ in Kenya, its widespread adoption by the youth, its harnessing by social healthcare agencies and its growing potential as an urban and cross-border trading language. The study argues for the official acknowledgement of ‘Sheng’ and corpus planning in order to harness such subcultural codes popular amongst the youth as a means of facilitating regional development. It was disseminated at a conference at the University of Khartoum, Sudan, 2013."

How effective are these frameworks in addressing the complexities that surround language and development within the interactive global economic terrain? How effectively could language and development be addressed within an inter-disciplinary framework? Methodologically, this is a conceptual-theoretical study using critical discourse analysis derived from Foucault and Bakhtin to demonstrate the need for macro-language and development studies to adopt an inter-disciplinary framework incorporating subjects within the Humanities and Social Sciences to provide an integrated perspective of the role of language in social and economic development. In the tradition of CDA the study aimed to offer ‘a different mode or perspective of theorizing, analysis, and application throughout the whole field’. It examined theorization of language and development within discrete subject disciplines in the Humanities (sociolinguistics, language and culture) and in the Social Sciences (the sociology of language and the economics of language). These were juxtaposed with Bourdieu’s theory on the sociology and economics of language exchanges notably his concept of the exchange of linguistic and ‘language capital’ within different linguistic markets. Developing an inter-disciplinary framework, the study integrated concepts, theories and perspectives from sociolinguistics, language and culture, the sociology of language, development studies, macroeconomics politics, history and education. This framework was applied to postcolonial language policy, development discourse and empirical studies in the economics of language to analyse and reveal the limited nature and value of bounded subject-disciplines in the theorization of the role of language in social and economic development within the shifting cultural landscape, changing skills demands and economic opportunities evolving in the interactive global labour market.  The work has been disseminated widely, including a keynote address at the 2013 Inaugural International Conference, Language Sciences for Developing Countries, Lahore Women’s College University, Pakistan."

This research project contributed to the University of Sunderland gaining the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) national award, 2013 Access to HE Higher Education Provider of the Year. The findings of the paper reveal that Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) need to rethink their communication strategies with adult learners. They need to offer added value pathways from FE to HE study, attractive solutions which respond to the need for agility and continuous change in both further and higher education. It also highlighted that transition from further to higher education study requires high-intensity support by academic and student-centred staff teams"

French thinkers such as Foucault and Derrida are often labeled as representatives of “poststructuralism.” Yet such an intellectual movement is unknown in France, where these theorists occupied positions too far apart to be
perceived as an intellectual group or movement. This study traces the evolution of the French intellectual field after the war when higher education institutions saw unprecedented growth. By drawing from Bourdieu's sociology of intellectuals , this study gives an account of the rise and decline of an intellectual generation which continues to leave its mark on the theoretical imagination of our time."

Since the first edition by Dörnyei (2001), the language motivation field has changed significantly, reflecting the impact of language globalisation, shifting theoretical paradigms and alternative research methodologies – particularly, qualitative approaches I have long championed, for which reason I was invited as co-author. Thus this is largely a new book that has been completely rewritten to take account of major developments within the field, and includes a new 9,000–word chapter on current socio-dynamic and complex systems perspectives. Of the book’s four sections, I took primary responsibility for I, II and IV, and the discussion of qualitative research in III."

Initiator of the book Contract with Continuum, including authorship of the original book proposal; 
Oversight of the international and thematic balance of the project, ensuring that contributors’ chapters connected to the local/global theme and did not overlap; 
Direct liaison with roughly a third of the contributors, providing editorial support, including comments on drafts, corrections to grammar and style; 
Receiving and editing all contributors’ copy; 
Arranging for preparation of the Index, Selected Bibliography and List of Resources;
Joint author of the first ‘Introduction’ and final ‘Conclusions and Implications’ Chapters, and the Introductions to each of the book’s sections;

They provide a critical evaluation of cognitive explanations of second language learning phenomena and associated empirical work. The two previous editions of this book have not included most of the areas addressed by these two chapters, including implicit learning, usage-based emergentist approaches to language learning, O'Grady's efficiency driven processor, defining and measuring explicit knowledge, skill acquisition theory, role of different memory systems and attention. The chapters are unique in bringing these theories together and evaluating their explanatory power and their associated empirical base to date (other volumes, books, handbooks do not evaluate or integrate them as a whole)."
