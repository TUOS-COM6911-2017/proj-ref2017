To this end the piece builds upon an earlier generation of English School scholarship through the introduction of historical sociological insights into the nature of the international system. It shows the distinctiveness of intervention as a specific modality of coercion which is particularly suited to the ordering and re-ordering of the tensions that arise between territoriality and transnationalism.  
This contextualisation of the practice of intervention helps to explain its longevity (whilst such cognate practices as industrial inter-state warfare and formal colonial empire have withered); to appreciate the variation in intervention regimes over time; and to better understand the changing nature and problems of intervention in the present age.  Within the wider literature on intervention the piece marks a counter-balance to the ‘presentist’, liberal normative focus of much contemporary research on the topic.  
The ideas presented in this piece formed the basis of a successful bid for ESRC seminar series funding (RES-451-26-0667) and provided the framework within which participants developed their own contributions.  The project was then successful in open competition for the award of a special issue of the Review of International Studies.

This was the first study of national signifance of the views of white working class communities on community cohesion across three different cities. The key research themes were identifying how these communities perceive community cohesion, assessing how challenges, issues and opportunities overlap between people living in the different areas, and promoting a greater understanding of how communities may contribute to the cohesion debate. An independent project advisory group (composed of senior academics from Oxford, Bradford and the Open Universities as well as JRF research managers) provided peer challenge at each stage of the process

Research design and methods 
• Critical review of literature: Critical evaluation of policy and academic literature on community cohesion since the publication of the government inquiry into 2001 riots.  This included defining white, and working class, reviewing academic publications and refining research questions.
• Local fieldwork: Neighbourhood-based fieldwork led to more 150 residents being engaged across the three areas.  Thematic analysis was used to identify consistent findings in the neighbourhoods.
• Data analysis: A 30,000 word final report synthesising data and research findings.
• Joint seminar: Bringing together a sample of 15 participants and practitioners from the three areas to discuss project findings.

Dissemination
A project launch was held at the RSA London in 2011 and attended by 50 academics, policy makers and practitioners.  A further event was convened at the House of Commons in 2012 to disseminate findings to parliamentarians.  The research has been covered in the national and international media including the BBC and the Huffington Post and been the subject to over 1,000 tweets."

Two questions guided this research: i) Can decentralised governance, local institutions, farmer knowledge and participation contribute to the alleviation of hunger and poverty in the drylands of south India? ii) How can modern digital video technology help facilitate research with, for and by people – rather than on people – for learning and change?

Methodology
Participatory methodologies supported power-equalising research that gave the least powerful actors more significant roles than before in the production and validation of knowledge. The methodological design enabled:
• Free prior informed consent and jointly developed rules of engagement 
• Formation of safe spaces – in which actors involved can gain confidence, discuss, analyse, mobilize and act on the basis of a shared vision
• Cognitive justice – acknowledging the right for different knowledge systems to exist. In this instance, participatory video film-making allowed marginalized farmers to not only express their knowledge but also affirm its legitimacy and validity.
• Extended peer review. Both powerful and less powerful actors were involved in co-validating the research and knowledge produced. 

Dissemination
Research processes and outcomes were presented in (inter)national fora, - including the 2008 Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Bonn (Germany), Government in India (2010), and courses at Cornell University (USA), University of London (UK), University of Hohenheim (Germany), and three Universities in India. Two of the films are available on Internet thereby ensuring global dissemination. Feedback on impacts confirms that this REF output sets a unique precedent on how to include marginalised people in research on food security and governance in India. Outcomes of this research are a milestone in the history of participatory video, - producing images that empower marginalised women farmers.

The aim of this research, which was funded by Daphne III, was to research female genital mutilation (FGM) affected communities in the EU to understand why the practice of FGM persists in the EU despite many years of campaigning to end this illegal  practice. The aim was to produce a behavioural change model that could be applied to ending FGM in the EU.

Research Design and Methods
The research was undertaken using community-based participatory action research methods to collect rich qualitative information. The research focussed on the Somali and Sudanese communities in the Netherlands and UK. Using  community researchers, focus groups were undertaken with men and women separately in the selected communities, representing a range of ages, marital status and length of time resident in the EU. This was followed by narrative studies with individuals to elicit more indepth information concerning the belief systems surrounding the practice of FGM and to understand the complex interrelationship between the individual and the community in terms of the perpetuation of the practice. The information  was analysed using nvivo. A sample of campaigns/interventions aimed at ending FGM was also analysed to assess the adoption of behavioural change models.  The research findings were then mapped against various behavioural change theories.  As a result the research provided a new cyclic framework based on behaviour change concepts for tackling the practice of FGM in the EU. 

Dissemination
The REPLACE Framework Cyclic Model, provides a new approach to tackling FGM in the EU that is community-focussed, culturally sensitive and empowers individuals and communities to work together to end the practice of FGM. This is available as a toolkit that is freely available for download on www.replacefgm.eu.

What institutional and methodological innovations are needed to put previously marginalised farmers at the heart of the governance of agricultural research?

Methodologies
Methodologies combined to develop a trustworthy and rigorous process of co-inquiry: 
• Multi-actor steering group to oversee the process
• A cycle of reflection-action-reflection controlled and decided by the steering group and farmers themselves 
• Farmer-led evaluations of national research programmes
• Methods for Deliberative and Inclusive Processes (DIPs) e.g. citizens' juries 
• Video film and radio, with teleconferencing technology to link local voices with decision makers 
• Independent oversight panels to ensure fair, transparent and credible processes
• Exchanges with other regions through farmer exchanges for mutual learning, roundtables, seminars and workshops focusing on agricultural research and food security
• Policy and media dialogues at (inter)national levels to bring farmer/citizen voices into decision making processes and definitions of the public good.

Dissemination
A policy dialogue organised in Ghana between farmers and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) ensured widespread dissemination and media coverage of this REF output. This high level policy dialogue was chaired by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food. A video conference link between Ghana and the UK House of Parliament allowed West African farmers to voice their policy recommendations to MPs and DFID (a major donor of AGRA).
Information on this REF output was further disseminated through i) a peer reviewed article and two policy briefs; ii) through presentations by the lead author to international research organisations e.g. Bioversity International (2011), the Global Forum on Agricultural Research (2013) and donors (Swiss Development Cooperation, 2013); iii) international farmer exchanges that led to wide dissemination of this output through horizontal networks of farmers and food consumers (e.g St Ulrich workshop on Democratising Agricultural Research, Germany, 2013).

Research question
The premise underpinning the LAP policy initiative was that that services for older people need to be accessible, relevant and tailored to individual needs. LAP was concerned with building a vision of a strategic, whole systems approach;  one which put older people at the centre of policy making and service delivery.
The aims of the review were to report on the benefits for (and to) older people of the LAP approach. This was done by reporting the benefits in relation to: ‘social’ benefits; safety; ‘health’ (both physical and mental health); education; leisure; occupational benefits;  welfare;  transportation.

Methodology
The report developed a theoretical analysis by using an inverted ‘triangle of care’ as a mechanism for framing and examining preventive approaches to supporting older people to remain independent.  This framing was used to analyse primary data (from interview notes, examination of documents – minutes and reports) and secondary data (examination and analysis from evaluation reports of each of the various LAP pilot sites). 

Dissemination
The main dissemination was via the publication of the research findings by the funder, the DWP.  This was launched by the then Minister for Pensions and Ageing Society, the Right Honourable Rosie Winterton(1) as well as a brief summary report produced and distributed by DWP(2)  and the full report made available on the DWP website(3) .  In addition, presentations were delivered at various academic and policy conferences.

The key aim was to critically appraise  “campus relations”, community cohesion and the prevention of violent extremism (the Prevent agenda) within further and higher education sectors.

Research design and methods
• Peer review: convening of an Independent Board chaired by Professor Madeleine Atkins (VC: Coventry University and, from January 2014, Chief Executive, HEFCE) with VCs of Kings College and Essex University also members. 
• Critical review of literature: An extensive review of literature relating to “campus relations”, “safe colleges”, and the Prevent agenda.
• Stakeholder interviews:  More than 20 interviews were conducted with national bodies and policy-makers.
• National Survey: An extensive national survey of 462 higher and further education institutions was conducted. 
• Case studies: Area-based case studies were conducted in six places in England with interviews with more than 70 people inside and outside universities and colleges. 
• Interactive workshops: Four workshops (attracting over 200 people) were held in London, Cambridge, Birmingham and Bradford to discuss research themes. 
• Data analysis:  A 15,000 word final report was composed. 
Dissemination
An internal workshop was convened for senior staff from universities, colleges and government departments.  The report has helped to shape policy and discussion in Universities UK and cited in the Home Affairs Committee Report (2012) Roots of Violent Radicalisation."

The key research questions were i) examine the links between HIV/AIDS and the agricultural sector, ii) describe the impacts of HIV/AIDS on food security, iii) explore the reciprocal relationship between access to organic food and nutrition and HIV/AIDS especially for rural people with little or no access to high levels of medical attention required for HIV/AIDS treatment, iv) discuss the impact of improved and diversified foods on preventing or reducing HIV/AIDS, v) document the evidence on which further research can be conducted, and vi) make recommendations on HIV/AIDS programming.   A literature review was supported by the development of regionally diverse case studies drawing from partners and contacts in Sub Saharan Africa who provided both documentation and interviews. These contacts and key informants were sourced in the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, the USA, DR Congo, Tanzania, Zambia and Kenya.  During the research, distinct categories were identified in the policy debate on HIV/AIDS, agriculture and nutrition, as well as critical blind spots. A final report was produced as a policy document intended to inform and provide recommendations to governments, international organisations and donors on the potential contribution of sustainably produced food and nutrition in tackling the impacts of HIVAIDS in Sub Saharan Africa.  
The report is publicly available from the website of the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements.  It has also been translated into French for West African nations.

The book discusses the difficulty of achieving 'social peace' in Northern Ireland, and argues that political agreement does not mean de facto social reconciliation. Violence has not disappeared, but has found new ways and actors through which to express itself. Facing a gradual fracture between political organizations and their respective communities, the peace process has been unable to build trust. The book thus argues that a decrease in inequalities and discrimination cannot be enough to reach reconciliation if local communities do not appropriate this goal. Local intercommunity dialogue must be complementary to the more general discussions on the province’s future.",,,,False,Nominated for the Prix du Livre Européen (European Book Prize) in 2011.

The current study focuses on Europeanisation and the emergence of new patterns of governance in Ireland.  The book examines how Europeanisation affected Irish policy-making and implementation, providing both a theoretical discussion of Europeanisation, as well as looking at a number of case studies (economy, agriculture, regional, environment and foreign policy).  It concludes that while Europeanisation led to significant institutional learning and policy adaptation by Ireland to Europe, domestic forces filtered those consequences, while global forces induced further adaptation."

It provides a theoretically informed analysis of the re-evaluation of Irish national security ordered by Ireland’s Taoiseach (Prime Minister) on September 11 2001, and the decisions taken as a consequence of it in the following seven years. In doing so it draws on unprecedented access to Ireland’s police, security and intelligence agencies; over twenty senior personnel agreed to be interviewed. Questions are raised over the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána (Ireland’s police and security agency), the relative absence of naval and airborne defence, and the impact on national security of the policy imperative to transform the Defence Forces, particularly the army, for more robust missions overseas. The book also considers the securitisation of Irish immigration policy despite international evidence suggesting the potential for radicalisation in socially marginalised western communities. The author demonstrates the importance of three conceptual models to the analysis of national security policy: historical institutionalism, governmental politics and threat evaluation. The Irish Naval Service made the book mandatory reading for all officers. Research for the book was supported by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS), which graded the project as Alpha* - Outstanding.  "

But it constitutes a significant advance on it in at least one major respect. The book identified as a critical risk to Irish security the unravelling of the public’s bind to the state, in the wake of troubling occurrences including judicial findings of systematic misbehaviour and poor management standards within Ireland’s national security apparatus. At issue also in this context were Ireland’s widely contested ability to deal with threats, and the introduction of draconian powers that might well equip a retreating state to tackle threats but if badly operated would backfire on the security apparatus and public perception of its integrity. The paper was triggered by the Irish Governments enactment, some months following publication of the book, of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009. The paper provided an urgently required theoretically-informed, inter-disciplinary analysis of its most radical impact: the act provided for the Irish military to undertake surveillance admissible in Ireland’s criminal and security courts. It was, thus, equipped equally to the civil power (the Garda) yet subject to significantly weaker public accountability mechanisms. Conceptually, the paper utilises concepts of broadened security associated with the Copenhagen School of Security Studies, as well as ideas of high and low policing borrowed from Criminal Justice and Policing Studies.

As a consequence of naval innovation in intra- and inter-organisational relationships, maritime-related globalised security threats were more effectively and efficiently contained (e.g. seaborne narcotics, environmental degradation). The article argues that further extension of the navy’s internalised logic of outward facing innovation through cooperation has altered deeply sedimented ideas and practices and, moreover, prompted a reimagining of naval role and function towards traditionally civilian concerns (e.g. job creation).  This reimagining represents a significant challenge to the boundaries of strategic studies. Conceptually, the article posits systematic innovation, a multi-disciplinary approach of organisational behaviour, as a means to both undertake contemporary naval analysis and as an approach by navies and their partners to achieving goals of joined up security, where security is broadly understood and participants are highly varied. The article is co-authored with Dr Terry Warburton, who assisted the principal author in delivering innovation training to the Irish Navy but did not undertake primary research for the article."

An earlier version was submitted to Ireland’s Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by way of expert consultation. At issue is the White Paper’s formulation of crime prevention in Ireland which, the article contends, is shot through with statist conceptualisations of what crime ‘is’. The research makes explicit a concomitant focus of the state upon crimes likely to be associated with areas of social disadvantage. Serious organised crime or crime of elite society (e.g. tax evasion, banking fraud) are virtually ignored in the process, and discourses for dealing with them proactively are purposefully elevated for state rather than public conversation. As such, the paper argues, the White Paper reinforces a blurring of boundaries between organised crime and security, as well as low and high policing, with the attendant risk of privileging powerful societal interests. Empirically, the paper, thus, corresponds with the research agenda unfolded in my monograph and paper, ‘Securing the State…’, centred upon structural deficiencies in Irish national security policy that through reinforcing social marginalisation raise security risk. Conceptually, the paper’s innovation lies in the use of the United Nations’ Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime as scaffolding in which national policy is evaluated and through which policy analysis is internationalised. The article was co-authored with Dermot P.J. Walsh and we were assisted in early secondary research by members of the Centre for Criminal Justice, University of Limerick."

It uses the theoretical conception of 'police' by Jacques Rancière to argue for the 'impossibility' of framing migrant political activism through the lenses of 'citizenship rights'. We argue that migrant political agency is impeded not only by policing of the border, but also by efforts to act 'on behalf' of migrants there. The article was published in a special issue on migrant protest in Citizenship Studies. The findings are addressed at academics working in this area, but have also been discussed by European 'no border' activists."

Maloney acted as a co-ordinator of this international research team from research design to dissemination.  His major contribution should be assessed on the basis of the Introduction (Chapter 1), Conclusion  (Chapter 14), substantive contribution (Chapter 6), project design, intellectual leadership and research management. The CID project followed a distinctive methodological approach and research design and involved data collection in 13 countries and 26 European communities. The research design includes three major components: (i) a survey of representative samples of the population in European countries, (ii) a study of voluntary associations in several European cities/communities, and (iii) a survey of citizens active in these associations. The three parts address similar questions about citizenship and involvement. For each part similar research designs have been developed (including common core questionnaires) and implemented in a number of countries. The population project provided analyses of individual citizens’ involvement and the antecedents of different modes of social and political behaviour. The organizational study focused on the collective opportunities and routes for social and political involvement. The activists survey focused on volunteers and active citizens within specific organizational contexts in European cities. The logic behind the surveys of organizations and their members was that organizational features are directly linked to the attitudes and behaviour of volunteers and activists. Furthermore, the characteristics of volunteers and activists are compared with the evidence obtained for the ‘average citizen’ provided by the population surveys. The research undertaken in this third output aims to systematically combine the results of the three parts of the CID-project.

For the award, the notion of “concept analysis” is understood broadly. It covers concept analysis, concept formation, and conceptual innovation as well as the fields of operationalization, measurement, and data collection. The jury for the 2012 award were: Bernhard Kittel, University of Vienna (chair), Michael Freeden, University of Oxford and Amy Poteete, Concordia University. The award citation states: 
“In summary, Lustration and Transitional Justice is a tight, coherent and well-structured study. It focuses on an issue with remarkable conceptual clarity and innovation, and attendant methodological backup. It is based on a convincing comparative setting and a persuasive case by case analysis. Conceptual analysis is executed on parallel levels of abstraction and sophistication. Its attraction is that it departs from the conventional technical arguments that the area of concept analysis often attracts, by following through the nuances of a concept with empirical and historical evidence of those nuances.”

Morgenthau’s French monograph La notion du politique from 1933.  Behr has co-edited the book, arranged and overseen the translation and co-authored a 25,000 word introduction to Morgenthau’s text. The introduction contextualises Morgenthau’s early monograph in the political circumstances of his time, in the discipline of International Relations and its development, and in Morgenthau’s overall political theory.  It provides a comprehensive and synoptic introduction to the monograph, based on original archival research in three languages and a detailed understanding of Morgenthau’s philosophy. The introduction shows how a close reading of La notion du politique and a consideration of the core conceptual questions that Morgenthau considers in this short monograph are essential for a full understanding of realism, as well as Morgenthau’s particular version of it.

The theory is evaluated against a series of cases of institutional choice in global commerce from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. Although the book is co-authored, Walter Mattli took primary responsibility for empirical chapters on the mixed courts of Egypt (Chapter 4) and global accounting governance (Chapter 6) and for the theoretical conclusion (Chapter 7) contrasting the theoretical argument with standard rational design, historical and sociological institutionalist approaches. Duncan Snidal took primary responsibility for the general theoretical chapter (Chapter 2) and the analysis of the GATT/WTO (Chapter 3). The introductory chapter was written by all three authors."

The theory is evaluated against a series of cases of institutional choice in global commerce from the nineteenth through twenty-first centuries. Although the book is co-authored, Walter Mattli took primary responsibility for empirical chapters on the mixed courts of Egypt (Chapter 4) and global accounting governance (Chapter 6) and for the theoretical conclusion (Chapter 7) contrasting the theoretical argument with standard rational design, historical and sociological institutionalist approaches. Duncan Snidal took primary responsibility for the general theoretical chapter (Chapter 2) and the analysis of the GATT/WTO (Chapter 3). The introductory chapter was written by all three authors."

Hobson's) largely unpublished works. Specifically, it is a co-edited volume (John Hobson and Colin Tyler). However, Part 1 of the book is written solely by John M. Hobson (the REF author). It is pages 1-78 (comprising 5 chapters). So it is this whole section that comprises this REF return item. This item is an original piece of research that draws on new and largely unpublished material of JA Hobson’s – specifically a series of lectures that he gave on IR to the South Place Ethical Society (London) during the last decade of his life in the 1930s. From these JM Hobson develops a unique interpretation of JAH’s thinking on IR which goes well beyond the usual focus on imperialism. The introduction then links these lectures to many arguments that he made in a wide range of previously published books and articles to consolidate this different interpretation (covering the 1898 through 1938 period of his writings). Contrary to the received wisdom, these chapters argue that Hobson’s work went well beyond the analysis of imperialism and they explore his thinking on international government and the role that this should play in world politics, in addition to the point that JAH believed that imperialism, under certain circumstances, could play a positive role in improving the world. And there are other issues that are explored in detail, such as his anti-economic reductionist approach and his analysis of the international mind. Overall, these chapters provide a rigorous interrogation of JAH’s work through a kind of dialogical approach and its significance is that it taps into some of the key debates in the secondary literature on JAH’s thought, while providing a fresh angle to them."

By combining observational range and analytical rigour with empirical, theoretical and interpretive insights, the study produces a reconstructive synthesis that is unprecedented in scope and design.  It features an innovative methodology that takes account of the intersections between historical-biographical strands, social science approaches, normative-ethical dimensions, and domestic-international categories.

Its discussion of shifting attitudes to permissible and impermissible forms of harm is the result of a very considerable investment in comprehending relevant literatures in several disciplines– ethics, criminology, jurisprudence and process sociology as well as International Relations. The synthesis of core themes from those fields is based on extensive research on the method and argument of process sociology, and on hitherto unexplored links with English School theory. Leading reviewers have stressed the ‘astonishing’ range of the scholarship that underpins a work that changes ‘the field of vision’.

The book is based on extensive primary data collection in Sierra Leone over a ten year period. Fieldwork was conducted in three phases: during and immediately after the war, and during the post-war reconstruction period. The book draws on interviews with nearly 60 RUF combatants, conducted after long periods of rapport building. Research also included focus group discussions, participant observation and multi-day field-trips with demobilised combatants; and further interviews with ex-combatants from other factions, civilians who lived under RUF control and NGO workers. The research was hazardous and both the fieldwork and writing were unusually time consuming.
