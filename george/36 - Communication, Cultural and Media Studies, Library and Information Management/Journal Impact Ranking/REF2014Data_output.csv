In this research, Brown’s objective was to explore the representation of the lived experience of homelessness through fictional film. The process involved spending three months personally interacting and filming documentary material with rough sleepers in Derby in order to develop a “grounded” understanding (Glaser and Strauss 1967) of their lived experience. Although the film engages with the wider social context of homelessness, Brown’s aim from a research perspective was to explore, through fiction, how homelessness impacts on the individual relationship between a homeless father and his son. This theme arose directly from Brown’s qualitative research on the streets, through which he discovered that many homeless men choose not to reveal their living status to their family and, in particular, their children. 
Paper Hearts stars Gary Cargill (Route Irish, Kicks) and newcomer, Dylan Goodall, who trained at the acclaimed Television Workshop, Nottingham.  The film was nominated for Best Short Film at the BAFTA qualifying Rushes Soho Shorts Festival 2011, Best UK Short at the Oscar qualifying Leeds International Film Festival 2011 and Best Short Film at the Royal Television Society West Awards 2012.  The project received funding from IdeasTap’s Big Ideas Fund in late 2009. Kevin Spacey was one of the panellists who selected the project for funding and he presented Rob Brown with a cheque for £5,000 at the Old Vic in London in front of an audience of press and industry.
Paper Hearts premiered at the ICA in July 2011 and in competition at the Rushes Soho Shorts Festival.

10000571,36,,3099469,Q,Silent Things is a short film,,Film,,,,,,,,,,2010,http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/595/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"Silent Things is a 12 minute short film about how the friendship between an autistic man and woman is tested when a teenage girl comes between them. The film explores the difficulty that people with autism often face when communicating with neurotypical “others”.
From a research perspective, Brown’s objective was to investigate the challenge of representing autism through fictional film narratives. His attempt to use “projective” frames to explore everyday life is aligned with the “ethno-fiction” of Rouch (1958-67). However, Brown makes a significant departure from the ethno-fiction tradition, as is evident in his choice to avoid the multi-vocal representations of social themes that are a typical feature in the work of Rouch and his followers.  Brown, instead, seeks to explore the wider social context of autism through a personalised, intimate portrayal of everyday life.  
Brown’s research is grounded in a combination of qualitative and participatory methodologies. In the early stages of the research process, Brown and two of the lead actors spent time at a National Autistic Society centre in London exploring themes and approaches through a participatory workshop with a dozen people with autistic spectrum disorders. The findings from this process directly informed the writing and performance of the script. Qualitative audience feedback, following the production of the film, indicated that people with experience of autism perceive the film as authentic and emotionally salient.
Silent Things won the New Arrival Award at the 40th International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2011. The film was also broadcast on BBC HD in February 2012 and has screened at BAFTA qualifying festivals, such as the Raindance Film Festival 2010 where it received its world premiere. The project received £17,000 in funding from the UK Film Council and South West Screen in 2009.

Brown’s primary research objective was to explore approaches to representing ex-soldiers who are disenfranchised from their country of origin and marginalised within British society. The research engages with the contemporary social phenomena of child soldiers through a feature length film portrait of one boy’s everyday struggle to rebuild trust and adapt to “civilized” life after war. The work was developed through a participatory and qualitative research process with former child soldiers and with organisations working to rehabilitate child soldiers, including Human Rights Watch and War Child.
Brown’s secondary research objective was to explore the economic, creative and production challenges faced by filmmakers as they make the transition from short to long form filmmaking.  His research findings have, thus far, been shared through industry talks and interviews (2013).
The film was nominated for two awards at the BFI London Film Festival: the Sutherland Award, which commends the most original and innovative first feature at the London Film Festival (previous recipients include Bernardo Bertolucci, Jean Luc Godard and, more recently, Clio Barnard and Andrea Arnold); and Brown also received a Best British Newcomer nomination. Sixteen premiered at the Vue Cinema, Leicester Square on 14th October 2013 as part of the BFI London Film Festival.

Body Echoes was funded as curatorial practice in the arts and cultural sectors.  The research explored and developed digitally-aided processes for representing, remediating and augmenting the human body. The investigation aimed to enable new understanding of socio-cultural transformations across visual, media and performing arts. It also considered the challenges faced by female artists seeking to integrate digital technologies into their practice.

Questions:
1. How can artists combine emergent digital technologies with existing processes, tools and practices?
2. How are cultural “ways of seeing” bodies (Berger) and phenomenological ways of “working” through bodies (Schutz) transformed through the application of digital technologies to established artistic practices? 

Process:
Soyinka initially used a curatorial process to select artists and pair them with digital technologists. She then designed a series of laboratory style mini-investigations and supported participants in developing and documenting their processes through photography and auto-ethnographic diaries. The findings were collectively analysed, shared and further developed in a workshop framework. Throughout the investigative process, cultural and sociological theories (in particular, Berger, Schutz and Haraway) were used to contextualise, frame and develop the research. 

Context/Insights: 
Through this investigative process, Soyinka and the research participants positioned digital technologies as tools that can aid, disrupt or extend embodied processes of artistic production and reception. In the research laboratories, participants used digital technologies (such as a digital video feedback circuit) to disrupt pre-existing processes and patterns of interaction. This led to the production of social and discursive spaces through which opportunities for representational, cultural or material transformation emerged.

Dissemination:
Bodies Echoes was the pivotal point in an ephemeral series of works presented through digital laboratories, workshops, exhibitions and performances nationally and internationally between 2008 and 2009.  The Arts Council of Wales, Wales Arts International, The Women’s Arts Association and the British Council funded this series.

10000571,36,,3099488,T,Translating Tales of the Trickster,,"AHRC research project outcomes - performances, workshops and visualisations ",,,,,,,,,,2011,http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/1726/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"How can we create interdisciplinary dialogue around the theme of the Trickster, incorporating perspectives from mythology, creative writing, performance, criminology and online cultures?

Origins and Context
Funded by the AHRC, the objective was to create a framework for developing practitioner-led research into transformations of Trickster mythology and narrative form across contemporary practices of writing, performance and lived experience. 

Process
The research took place over six months, beginning and ending with interdisciplinary workshops. Soyinka curated a series of Trickster performances (including new works produced through the research) and collaborated with artists to create Trickster visualisations.  To share and progressively focus research insights, she presented these resources within workshops and through a prototype, online archive. 

Insights
The process of interdisciplinary dialogue around this theme highlighted significant differences between the social-cultural function of Trickster within oral storytelling sub-cultures and mainstream cultures.  In oral storytelling circles, Trickster is represented as a complex, poetic and ambiguous character.  His social function, beyond the story, is to encourage audiences to explore moral thresholds and to consider values and limits to disruptive action.  In mainstream culture, Trickster is most typically represented as a one-dimensional psychopath.  The contemporary focus of Trickster as a criminal “passing” for someone else may relate to our dominant networked culture of appearances, in which it is increasingly difficult to separate a “real” person from their online identity/ image.  More generally, Trickster appears to hold salience within times of strain, trauma and socio-economic transformation

Dissemination:
The work was disseminated through a range of cultural and creative institutions, including The Pervasive Media Studio, the Tobacco Factory, The George Ewart Evans Centre for Storytelling and Beyond the Border International Storytelling Festival.  The online archive reached international audiences and research findings were presented in a keynote speech at an international conference at the University of Maine in 2013.

Funded through REACT and originally conceived as a work of process design, this research aimed to develop a digital distribution system that works with the transience of oral culture.

Context 
When a story is shared orally, ownership is gained through listening and retelling, rather than by physical possession. In live performances of poetry and storytelling, the text lives through human interaction and interpretation. Working in this context and with ‘oral literacy’, the challenge was to create a digital system that enabled books to ‘behave’ like oral stories, living within and beyond publication. 

Process
The research investigation involved an iterative process of system and interaction design.  Soyinka initially produced a platform design and specification and, then, over a three-month period, the team rapidly developed and tested a series of prototypes with live audiences.

Insights
As the research progressed, it became apparent that the audiences placed greatest value on the human and performative aspects of the system. The challenge, therefore, became a social one: how do we enable readers and authors to engage with books as objects in translation?  The innovation in the research lay in the creation of a digital system that interfaces with real-world editorial processes and local delivery systems to create responsive and adaptive publication experiences.

Dissemination 
At a one-day event in March 2013, an international team of translators gathered in situ (or via internet connections) at the birthplace of Dylan Thomas to engage in instantaneous translation and performance of poetry using Book Kernel.  The audience added their own comments and suggestions to the live translations and three versions of the book, including a bound printed edition, were produced on the day. The Book Kernel approach to publishing has since been showcased at several national events, including the Digital Cardiff Week and the Guardian Activate conference.

The research explored challenges in directing performance across multiple platforms. Given the centrality of the director to performance and moving image productions, researchers need to develop and articulate an awareness of emergent working practices across 360-degree storytelling platforms.  In this context, the research asked: how is the director’s process being transformed as the industry shifts from single-platform screen, stage and online productions towards multi-platform storytelling environments? 

The body of work investigated as part of this research received support from The National Theatre Wales (NTW), the Pervasive Media Studio, The British Council and the University of the West of England SPUR scheme.

Process 
The research involved a series of mini-investigations, conducted by Soyinka through her industry practice as an emergent director on Branches, The Nature of Crisis (2012) and her experimental work as a director on a Waleslab multiplatform pilot (2011). Throughout the investigation, Soyinka recorded ethnographic notes and video which she used as tools for reflexive analysis and discussion. 

Insights
Soyinka observed significant differences between cultural practices in “single” and multi-platform productions. In single platform theatre productions, the technical team is often consulted towards the end of the rehearsal process, whereas, in multi-platform productions, the technologists would expect to be included in creative decisions at an early stage. The multiplatform director, thus, generally demanded a greater versatility from the crew and production team than would normally be expected.  Actors, for example, had to quickly adapt their performances across platforms and new, hybrid roles emerged, including a writer-technologist employed to “perform” live text messages sent to audience members.

Dissemination: 
In addition to the creative outputs themselves, the research was shared through specialist industry forums and presentations. This included a live video link up with interactive artists from Casablanca organised by the British Council and NTW in 2013.

Its themes are informed too by my own background as a cultural worker, having run a creative design business for 10 years.
 
My PhD (part-time) at the Centre for Cultural Policy Studies at the University of Warwick explores the social contexts of cultural entrepreneurship, engaging with the nature of entrepreneurial work and dispositions within a Bourdieusian framework. Empirical research explores strategies for self-identification and personal agency, illuminating the complexities of entrepreneurship through the lived experience of cultural workers with examples from amongst those based in the city of Birmingham, UK. PhD research themes and research for this article were further explored through teaching on the MA Media and Creative Enterprise and in my leadership role in the wider PG environment in BCMCR, working in particular with students to raise critical questions about the nature of cultural entrepreneurship and their practice.
 
This work builds also on an earlier article co-authored with Charlotte Carey of BCU, Enterprise Curriculum for Creative Industries Students (2006), and on themes developed in various conference presentations. Having organised four conferences on the subject of Creative Enterprise since 2007, I have developed some expertise on the subject as it applies to higher education, the creative industries sector and cultural policy makers. The opportunity to lead the curriculum development aspect of a European funded Interreg project, ECCE, for three years has broadened my understanding of and contribution to innovation and enterprise within the creative industries.

The primary research itself was conducted in conjunction with Prof Andrew Dubber as part of a wider team of academics working with what was then called BBC Music & Audio Interactive, and was published in a BBC report and an article for a special issue of The Radio Journal. In this book chapter I reframed our findings within a much broader context of what the BBC calls user-generated content. Radio, and especially specialist music radio, is often neglected within the corporation’s institutionalised idea of new media forms, and the chapter explores both the ways in which a range of specialist music fans build communities around their interests, and the way that BBC staff conceive of this activity relative to their own professional practices.

These would include examinations of the professional practices and discourses of radio workers, the role of new digital and online technologies within media institutions like the BBC, and the communities which people build online. As in much of my work, I aimed at a methodological approach which synthesises political economy with cultural studies of professional and consumption cultures, and applies them to emerging areas of media practice and form.

It was written as a contribution to an edited collection of studies of medievalism in videogames, part of the Routledge Studies in New Media and Cyberculture series. The book aims to address a notable gap in the field, given the volume of such analysis that exists for other media forms, film being a primary example. The chapter draws out themes from my other work on games, in concentrating on the culture of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), and some of my recent historical work, on which I collaborated with centre colleague Tim Wall to explore the cultural history of mobile music technology. My current work extends these ideas into a more general engagement with MMOGs and/as history, alongside an exploration of the games industry as a context of cultural work, in collaboration with colleagues from BCU’s vocationally orientated GamerCamp.

Two of these focused on the jazz music industries, and one included a presentation from Chris Mapp, a jazz musician and member of the Birmingham-based jazz collective Cobweb, stimulating our interest in this area. (Other speakers included the producer/director and researcher of the BBC TV documentary Jazz Britannia, itself an object of research for colleagues in our centre). Our first draft of this article informed two conference papers, including one at the Rhythm Changes European Jazz conference, and one at Live Music Exchange Conference in Leeds in May 2012. Feedback from these presentations encouraged us to extend the piece, and we produced a final draft which built on Wall’s work on the professional practices of jazz musician and Professor Andrew Dubber’s research into mapping the jazz scenes in New Zealand cities. Such collaborations have been a significant way in which I have established my post-doctoral career, and through this work I have established strong links with the jazz programme at the Birmingham Conservatoire and regional and national jazz promoters. This article presented the first detailed academic analysis of UK-based contemporary jazz collectives, and examined how collective practice allowed them to create performance opportunities, sustain production cultures and negotiate their relationships with the music industries. I’ve since extended this work with projects on the late British jazz drummer Tony Levin and with UK jazz label Edition Records, and Wall and I intend to publish further work on jazz collectives in 2014.

The goal of this work was to give a historical account of the complex political, cultural and economic territory surrounding new digital recording in the 1970s, and to critically analyse the reasons behind industry take-up of these new technologies, as well as resistance to them. Prior to publication I presented this research in December 2010 at the Art of Record Production conference, held at Leeds Metropolitan University. In both the publication and the conference paper I consider ideas related to political economy, entrepreneurship, and digital culture, all key themes within BCMCR. Taking the themes of technology and enterprise, and looking in particular at the disruptive nature of the advances made by the entrepreneurial activities of Soundstream, there are parallels here with the work of my colleagues Professors Andrew Dubber and Tim Wall, who have looked at the way in which organisations operating within the present day music industries are negotiating the importance of internet technologies.

There is little current research into the politics of music/sound collectives on a transnational scale, so this issue has the potential to reorient debates in jazz and music history, which have mostly dealt with individual musicians or have been limited to national developments. Moreover, the introductory essay frames the central problem of jazz collectives in terms of the development of new sonic practices and cultural spaces, highlighting their significance to theories of mediation and audience reception more generally. This places the politics of music/sound collectives at the very centre of the problem of modernity/modernism, and not on its margins, as is usually the case.

The collectives project aims to redefine the subject of jazz and popular music history, and to become a primary and essential point of reference for jazz and popular music scholars. Its impact has resulted in invitations to present aspects of this research in Denmark, France and Canada, and most of the research (including this introductory essay) will form the basis of a volume of essays that has been accepted for publication by Routledge USA as part of their new transnational studies in jazz series.

Specifically, the chapter aims to draw on new research directions in popular music and cultural industries research attending to sound and issues of performance in a range of historical contexts, and apply them in classical music studies. The research explores Ravel's work in terms of the nature of cultural production and reception within the classical music industries and in particular seeks to place modernist composers in the context of both their historical moment and the operation of US cultural industries.

This perspective is particularly valuable given the ongoing popularity of Ravel recordings with Durand/BMG, new recordings on Deutsche Grammophon, and the appearance of The Cambridge Companion to Ravel (CUP, 2000) which brought together key Anglohone scholars with French counterparts, as well as a growing range of academic monographs and articles attending to the composer such as those published in 19th Century Music, Twentieth-Century Music, The Journal of the American Musicological Society and Music Analysis.

This was one of the first academic conferences I attended and indicates my emergence as an early career researcher and practitioner. The paper builds on my work in establishing the Birmingham Music Archive in 2008, an avowedly civic-minded project which aims to celebrate the city of Birmingham and its musical heritage. Returning to academia from the music industries after a considerable absence, scholars in the School of Media encouraged me to be reflexive about my practice-based work. This led me to reflect on my approach to popular music heritage, asking questions of how communities form online around popular music and what role it plays in people’s everyday lives. 

Collaborating with Paul Long on this piece broadened my understanding of the theoretical landscapes of practices of cultural heritage, not just in terms of popular music, but its relationship with space, place and identity, and more significantly, with memory studies. This intellectual leap has prompted me to extend and deepen my work in this field, to look beyond just the ‘music’ of popular music to it’s associated cultures, ephemera and to the role it plays in individual and collective memory, heritage, activist archival practices and the everyday lives of people and communities. 

The beginnings of this work are laid out in this article and are the base upon which I have built further research and publications in the field on online popular music archives, histories and heritage. This approach also informed my activity as the originator and executive producer for the Screen West Midlands funded film Made in Birmingham (2010).

Although the analyses build firmly on work I had published in 2006 on dancing and music culture on the Northern Soul scene, my objective was to make a distinctive contribution to the emerging, and long neglected, area of vernacular dance by integrating approaches developed within media and cultural studies. The records at the heart of the British Northern Soul culture were produced during this historically-specific and often neglected moment in US cultural history. While there had been some work on television dance parties of the late 1950s and early 1960s by the book editor, the so-called ‘fad dances’ and the associated pop music on which they are built are treated as trivial forms within cultural history, popular music studies and analyses of vernacular dance. My analysis draws upon a reinterpretation of the bi-racial pop music of the time, a theorisation of ‘fads’ as culturally important in terms of late ’50s and early ’60s ideas of modernism and the transmission of black culture to white teenagers in the US, and a revision of the widely held contention that dances of this time represented a significant shift to individual, rather than collective, dance. By combining analysis of dance movement, an understanding of the changing structures of US radio and television at the time, and the context of US youth culture during the time of the civil rights movement, my objective was to open up the way ‘fad dances’ were represented and understood."

The special edition of Key Words sought to collect work directly committed to the excavation and analysis of marginalized culture, building on the spirit of that aspect of the work of Raymond Williams that was addressed to constructed cultural traditions. While the poetry of Louis MacNeice is well-known, my contribution explored his radio work as a means of defamiliarising his canonical status in order to evaluate his approach to and hopes for the possibilities of radio as popular art. In so doing, this research considers the nature of the retrieval of radio as an ephemeral medium, the experience of which, as argued by MacNeice, is not simply a matter of assessing the script as written but assessing its materiality as sound. Thus, this act of retrieval and historical imagination developed the conjunction of media and cultural history and of the politics of creative production, of what is remembered, how historical narratives are constructed and indeed, what aspects of the production are accessible. One development of the archival work led to an invitation to act as organizer and panelist for ‘Research and repurposing?

Parts of this larger endeavour can be found in our published analysis of the rest of the Britannia music series, in our work on director Tony Palmer, and work that has emerged from our participation in the HERA Rhythm Changes European Jazz project, like my collaborations with Barber on jazz collectives. The Jazz Britannia three-part television documentary was significant in terms of both British jazz history (as the first comprehensive television analysis of the music) and BBC documentary form (as the first in a series of prominent music history documentaries), and the analysis sought to examine both the way it was positioned as ‘cultural history’ and ‘quality television’. By publishing in an international jazz journal we aimed to establish a more developed approach to studying popular music history and music mediation within a fast changing field.

Building on my analyses of mediated popular music histories I argued that, in jazz studies, such primary sources are usually organised by existing narratives about the genius of selected artists. Here I built an analysis of a historical moment up from the primary material treating Ellington as a cultural worker in a new media field of emerging institutions and a cultural field of modernism and racialised practice. I drew on a range of media and cultural theory approaches including political economy, cultural studies and ideas of music mediation to offer an alternative way to understand Ellington, his music and historically-located practices.

It was developed after an approach from the publishers as I began to use the research to inform public conferences, publications and projects. This work has its gestation in the experience of completing MA work on everyday cultural production in the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and in response to cultural studies theory and agendas encountered there in which the practices and impulses of creative work were largely overlooked. The aim was to seek out evidence of historical practice and theories of cultural production beyond the familiar founding tales of the field and narratives of the post war period associated with the New Left, Angry Young Men and at the Kitchen Sink, considering the manner in which such work evinced contemporary discourses of class, culture and creativity. The intention was to make available my historicisation of cultural debate and the neglected and untold histories that added texture to our understanding of the ‘welfare culture’. Thus, beyond the remit of PhD, the book was aimed at an audience of public historians and scholars of media and cultural studies, emphasizing the interdisciplinarity of the approaches and conceptual framework of the research. 

The book established many of the themes that I have pursued in subsequent work as Reader in Media and Cultural History and lead in research for archives and heritage for BCMCR. In addition, the process of unearthing new archives, and innovating in exploring the range of sources available for retrieving practice and thought is an approach that informs explorations of contemporary cultural work in my role on the AHRC-funded ‘Cultural Intermediation: Connecting Communities in the Creative Urban Economy’.

The research unearthed an interface between legacies of a radical sixties culture, CCCS activities in the city of Birmingham and cultural policy. This work informed a public exhibition in the first instance and initial research led to my contribution of a contextual piece on Channel 4 and the wider socio-cultural milieu of the 1980s, which appeared as part of the exhibition ‘Participation: The Film and Television Workshop Movement, 1979-1991’.

This paper presents an in depth analysis of resistance as a growing identity in the Arab and Muslim world which defies the dominant representation of Islam as synonym to extremism or terrorism. 

I published this paper while I was still a PhD student in Paris, and the core of my work revolved around offering a broader yet more solid understanding of Arab militant and resistant discourses. Ultimately, I believed such an approach would contribute to unpicking the complexity of the notion of political Islam, especially the politics of its representation by Western media. As I’ve recently joined the Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural Research, I’m now focusing my work on the relationship between media literacy and social change in the MENA region, leading our research projects on this subject and collaborating with US technology company Meedan, along with a number of regional partners. The knowledge I was able to build through my work on Hezbollah media strategies and on how they represented a shift from the pan-Arab revolutionary narratives of the fifties and the sixties is today my biggest asset to better understand the complexities of the social and political turmoil the Arab region is now facing.

The article draws on findings and insights from my PhD research project and book Artistic Lives (Ashgate, 2013). The PhD research explored the working and living conditions for freelancers in the arts. In particular, it examined factors outside of arts funding and cultural policy such as the cost of housing, as well as benefits and employment. The PhD project represents my first significant attempt to explore these issues. Whilst the project is based in cultural studies, it also draws on other fields such as urban sociology and social policy studies. It is thus an interdisciplinary project and I hope it and planned outputs such as this one will be read by academics within a range of fields including urban sociology, cultural studies and those researching the cultural economy, as well as practitioners. 

The article explores the myths of the bohemian lifestyle, and its popularisation through mass culture, the popularity of the ‘artist’s loft’ (drawing on Sharon Zukin’s work), as well as its globalization – as cities such as Berlin become seen as international destinations for followers of a bohemian lifestyle. The article then examines the marketing of the bohemian lifestyle by property developers and city officials in Berlin.

Many of my colleagues are practitioners, and several research the politics and social conditions of cultural production. Here, my work informs and engages with debates that take place within this research community and the ongoing development of our attention to the production cultures.

I had visited India before and worked with the music charity Music Basti in Delhi as part of my knowledge exchange activities with grassroots music industry organisation UnConvention. I arranged for a practice based research and knowledge transfer project to take place in which colleague Jez Collins and I took a professional record producer to Delhi to work with the children in the homes for street kids to make a recording of a collection of songs that they had co-written with their Music Basti music workshop coordinators. We spent a week in India making the album and using handheld digital video cameras to allow the staff and students of Music Basti to tell their stories. The record was released online on Bandcamp which allowed for us to allow purchasers to choose the price they would like to pay - with all proceeds going to the Music Basti charity. The Monkey on the Roof website was designed by colleague Simon Barber and it allowed for web visitors to view videos that were of interest to them based on a series of metatags, before going on to make the music purchase, which we hypothesised would contribute to their decision-making process about how generous they would be when purchasing the album. In addition, the web interface was in turn used as inspiration for the music discovery interface subsequently implemented by Bandcamp after I demoed the site to them in my role as advisory board member. This paper explored the idea of these kinds of integrated activities as practice based research in a special issue of the Creative Industries Journal. "
10007140,36,,117741,C,Power Bottom:  Performativity in Commercial Gay Pornographic Video,,Columbia University Press,Hard to Swallow:  Hard-Core Pornography on Screen (ed. Claire Hines and Darren Kerr),,,,,978-0-2311-6213-5,,,,2012,,,False,,False,False,,,4,,,False,"This piece is a continuation of research into the iconography of gay porn that commenced with my doctorate. Whilst the academic study of pornography has gained a degree of validity over the course of the past 20 years, due in large part to the intervention of Linda Williams with the publication of Hard Core in 1989, there is a tendency to homogenise academic discourse on the subject. As theorists such as Laura Kipnis (1999) have argued, the result of this homogenisation serves to avoid engagement with the manifest content of the texts themselves and to overlook marginalized aspects of the form especially gay or lesbian pornography.

The emergence of the Power Bottom, epitomising an aggressive and predatory form of performativity that destabilises the active/passive dichotomy of sexual role in gay pornography, is a significant moment in the development of the genre. This new type of performance coincides with the emergence of the queer cultural and political agenda and an increased rejection of the politics of safer sex practices espoused (often problematically) in the gay pornographic text. In many ways the Power Bottom type predicts the even more problematic emergence of the barebacking phenomenon within the gay subculture, eroticised in the work of Treasure Island Video’s productions amongst others. This paper discusses and situates the emergence of the Power Bottom iconography and performativity and explores the extent to which the deployment of such a type can be regarded as a progressive or regressive phenomenon. The essay set the agenda for research during the audit, informing a monograph proposed for the post-REF period.

One of the functions that gay pornography performs has been to articulate ideals of sexual desire and alternative bodies and modes of representation have often been relegated from view or situated as abject. 

The advent of the internet has created conditions in which a diversity of types and modes of representation can proliferate alongside an exponential expansion (and bifurcation) of the market. Recent years have seen the increased popularity of so-called ‘Daddy Porn’ catering for (and creating) an interest in the older man and the mature body as a site of erotic fascination.

The essay discusses the implications of this development by focusing on the narrative, discursive and representational strategies of texts that present the older male as a sexual figure. The essay assesses the extent to which ‘Daddy Porn’ might be regarded as a progressive turn or whether this mode of representation is a reassertion of patriarchal masculinity and a problematic eroticization of abusive power dynamics.

The essay is a summation of work that has formed the backbone of my research activities and output during the REF audit period. This piece also indicates the direction that future work will take as it is lays the groundwork for the research for the monograph More than Meets the Eye: Masculinity, Representation and Gay Pornography, IBTauris, 2015/16. This work has aided in mentoring colleagues such as Oliver Carter whose research interests intersect around questions of sexual representation. As a result, Carter has become involved as a peer reviewer for the Porn Studies journal (I am reviews editor and inner editorial board member).

For the first time since the days of Sean Connery, James Bond was once again a sex symbol. Starting with the many examples offered by the James Bond franchise, this essay identifies the sex symbol as a ubiquitous but essentially ill-defined category of celebrity status. This is an essay that was written as a contribution to a special edition of Celebrity Studies; Sex and Celebrity, that I was guest editor for.

Challenging a ‘common-sense’ understanding of the sex symbol the essay emphasises the importance of the sex symbol as a way into understanding the complexity and mutability of attitudes towards sex and sexuality. The intention of this essay is to bring the category of sex symbol into critical view, to make some provisional suggestions as to the ways in which this phenomenon might be interrogated and to consider what the specific issues might be in relation to an understanding of the male sex symbol in particular.

This essay extends my work around gay representation to a wider consideration of the ways in which sexuality is represented across a diversity of media texts (although cinema is the primary focus here) and the ways in which the male body and ideals of masculinity are articulated in what is often described as an increasingly and for some problematically ‘sexualised’ contemporary culture. This work around representation and in particular gendered and sexualised representations lies at the heart of the work of the Screen Cultures research cluster.

Karen Ross)",,,,,978-1-4443-3854-6,,,,2011,,,False,,False,False,,,4,,,False,"This paper discusses the proliferation of websites that present apparently heterosexual men engaging in gay sexual practices for an assumed homosexual audience and the allied phenomenon (known by the vernacular expression) of the ‘gay for pay’ performer. Drawing on literature in the fields of gender and sexuality the paper explores the alibis deployed to justify and legitimise the transgression of hetero-normative conduct that these sites eroticise and discusses the extent to which this phenomenon offers ‘new’ models of sexuality or merely reinforces the status of hegemonic masculinity.

Whilst the longstanding practice in gay pornography of employing models who self-identify as heterosexual and the eroticisation of the signifiers of heterosexual masculinity are not new phenomena in and of themselves, I argue that the explicit and emphatic presentation of performers who are willing, as heterosexual men, to transgress the boundaries of hetero-masculinity in a public arena is a distinctive feature of these websites.
 
Inevitably the question of exploitation (a key and longstanding issue in studies of pornography more generally) arises. The essay assesses who is being exploited through the emergence of these websites: the heterosexual males who through economic necessity resort to sex work? The gay male audiences who are presented with reactionary desires for the unattainable ideal of the ‘straight’ man? Furthermore, is it the case that exploitation itself is intrinsic to the patterns of sexual desire that the internet both constructs and benefits from?

This essay is an addition to the body of research that I have undertaken into the ways in which masculinity is presented as an object of erotic investment. The essay has been translated into German for the peer reviewed film studies journal Montage AV and has been translated into Italian for an edited collection.

Within the research centre, I belong to the Screen Cultures research group, where my focus on audiences is shared by colleagues such as Oliver Carter, Kerry Gough and Faye Davies. My PhD research used data from focus groups with British and Norwegian viewers to examine the significance of gender and nationality in audience engagement with TV comedy. In this piece I contribute to the ongoing academic debate around the possibilities and constraints involved in the international trade of TV comedy by examining audience talk about two key issues: interlinguistic subtitling and the combination of “nationally specific” and “universal” programme elements. The article sought to further our understanding of how TV audiences perceive “national comedy” and how they respond to comedic programming in other languages. It also aimed to broaden the debate around transnational comedy in TV studies, which has tended to focus on the reception of US programming. Instead, I here examine the responses of Norwegian viewers to a British sitcom, and the responses of British viewers to a Norwegian show. This approach enabled me to compare two very different viewing cultures: While Norwegian TV schedules include a great number of subtitled UK and US programmes, British broadcasters have traditionally scheduled only English language TV shows. The article demonstrated that research participants tended to underestimate the ability of transnational viewers to enjoy “their” comedy. It also showed that a lack of experience with subtitled comedy posed only a minor obstacle for the British viewers. These findings suggested the potential for new opportunities in the international trade of TV comedy, and we have since seen a number of foreign language TV dramas on terrestrial British TV. This includes the Norwegian sitcom Lilyhammer (BBC Four 2012). "

I here contribute to the ongoing academic debate around the role of women in comedy by examining audience perceptions of the relationship between gender and humour in TV comedy. The analysis demonstrates how research participants marginalised comediennes by constructing shows centred around female characters as being “for women”, while shows centred around men were not seen to be gender-specific. The lack of high profile women in comedy is often a topic of debate in popular media, and this article helps shed light on some of the ways in which audience perceptions pose a challenge to progress in this area. Within the research centre, my interest in gender issues is shared by colleagues such as Faye Davies and John Mercer. It has also remained a key topic in my postdoctoral work, which includes research on Twilight audiences, romcom audiences and online audience responses to female comedy performers. "

Its primary research question was: ‘What would it take to make 3D digitisation a routine practical proposition for cultural insititutions?’ Conceived to answer this, the exhibition was designed as a journey, taking visitors through a sequence of exhibits illustrating stages from digital data capture through analysis, restoration, reconstruction and communication. The presentation of the heritage content was designed to engage visitors’ interpretive capacity and imagination, to present the latest digital innovations in the heritage sector, and to stimulate informed debate with cultural professionals, policy-makers and the public. The narrative spans an integrated workflow, with zones in the exhibition addressing research questions at each stage, employing iconic examples of cultural heritage in interactive exhibits. Initial trialling of individual exhibits with the public in London and Southampton reinforced the value of this approach and helped to improve the interactive systems. The core exhibition was complemented by three other elements, exhibited in juxtaposed spaces: in terms of local material, one exhibit showed an experiment in reconstructing Pete Webster’s stolen 1997 statue of Steve Ovett from publicly supplied photographs; in another area, several different technologies were also demonstrated live, with the public and local curators offered the opportunity to bring in objects to be digitised; finally, a set of ten evening workshops was organised to illustrate the research behind each exhibit in more detail. 

The Brighton exhibition subsequently toured in Italy (Naples National Archaeological Museum, Prato Piazza). Plans for showing in Egypt were disrupted, but selections of exhibits have been shown publicly in Cyprus, Berlin, London and Paris, and Brazilian funding committed for exhibiting in 2014. It is planned to convert the materials into an exhibition that can tour science centres. SEE DIGITAL PORTFOLIO.

Mendik uses the case study of Argento’s 1977 film Suspiria alongside a range of other Italian film from the era to examine critically how the director’s challenging film style and controversial and troubling images of sexual violence affected the wider critical reception of his work. This is the latest stage in Mendik’s research from his monograph Tenebrae (Flicks Books, 2000), part of his RAE submission of 2000, through to the co-edited volume Alternative Europe (Wallflower Press, 2004), part of his 2008 RAE submission. These new research arguments are integral to the structure of this documentary which distinctively interweaves academic, film critique and production perspectives. This approach enables synthetic engagement with issues relating to critical reception, stylistic construction, and gender controversies in Suspiria and Argento’s wider cinema. In connection with these, the examination also touches on popular cinematic representations of 1970s Italian terrorism (Anni di piombo) and the possible subversive lesbian subtexts they contain. The documentary was released in the UK in September 2009 as part of the UK DVD release of Suspiria distributed by Nouveaux Pictures, before being later distributed across Australia along with the Autralian 2012 DVD release. Fear at 400 Degrees generated national press coverage in the UK for its critical revaluation of Argento’s film, and in 2010 the documentary was selected for screening at international film festivals including the DAMS Film Festival, Rome, the Sitges Film Festival, Spain, and the Cyprus Days Film Festival.

Mendik’s documentary combines academic, critical and production analysis, considering wider theoretical debates on the film’s use of documentary aesthetics as well as its socio-historical context in Italy during the 1960s and 1970s. The documentary considers how Deodato’s film reflected wider issues of female economic engagement during the 1960s ‘economic miracle’, as well as the impact of 1970s terrorism on media representations of atrocities. It also explores more current debates around regional and racial myths of the Mezziogiorno (or Southern problem). Mendik uses the case-study of Ruggero Deodoto’s controversial 1979 film Cannibal Holocaust in a wider UK campaign, which in 2011 reversed a 26-year legal ruling that had led to the film being first outlawed and then heavily cut in UK territories. Mendik’s role in the campaign included co-authoring the formal bid (along with Professor Julian Petley of Brunel University), and requesting an advice screening ahead of a possible formal review of the film’s legal status by its current UK distributor. As part of the formal review Petley and Mendik’s defence indicated the need to fully theorise the film in light of its legitimate historical and cultural contexts. The Long Road Back From Hell was distributed in the UK on the DVD release of the film in September 2011, and was also selected in 2011 for the following international film festivals: Off-Screen Film Festival, Brussels; Sitges International Film Festival, Spain; Cyprus Days Film Festival. It was also selected for the Leeds International Film Festival in 2013.

10000961,36,,495253,Q,"The condition of the working class

A documentary feature film inspired by Friedrich Engels' 1844 book 'The Condition of the Working Class In England'. The film asks how much has really changed since 1844? The power relations in our society remain essentially the same. As a result working class people rarely get to tell their own stories. Their stories are told for them by people who have no experience of being working class. The consequences of this, politically, socially and culturally, are far reaching and devastating. As a way of exploring this, the documentary follows the making of a theatrical show by non-professionals which has 8 weeks to write and devise a show for public performance drawing on the participants' own experiences and linking them back to Engels' classic text. The film follows the group from first rehearsal to first night and links their struggle to get the performance on stage to the broader struggles of the working class today.",,Inside Film,,,,,,,,,,2012,http://www.conditionoftheworkingclass.info/,1,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"‘The Condition of the Working Class’ is a ground-breaking feature-length documentary that enables a group of working class people to tell their own stories, demonstrating the continued importance of class inequalities in contemporary Britain. Inspired by Friedrich Engels’ classic ‘The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844’, the project gives its participants a unique opportunity to articulate their own experience and provides a context within which to recognize the legitimacy of their identities, recovering their collective experience and memory from its marginalisation within the existing public sphere. They are enabled to engage in a form of cultural production that fosters their creativity and imagination in a manner unavailable in mainstream media. 

The film is a research-through-practice enterprise that began with the directors issuing a public call for a group of non-professionals from the working class in Manchester and Salford to come together to write a play based on a combination of Engels' book and their own experiences. Wayne and his co-director worked with a hired artistic director to help develop the theatrical performance. The documentary follows the process of theatrical production from first rehearsal to first-night performance. This is enhanced by archive footage (providing historical context) and interviews with people from the local area, who are asked about their lives in austerity Britain and their responses to Engels’ words. 

The project constitutes a significant contribution to documentary, both in its form and in demonstrating continuities between the context in which Engels wrote and a contemporary period that has witnessed a ‘retreat from class’ in political discourse and academic research. The film achieves its goals through a participatory-observational methodology and an original collaboration between film and theatre, offering a subversion of the limitations of the prevailing mainstream ‘Reality TV’ paradigm.

Released by Journeyman Pictures: http://www.journeyman.tv/62971/documentaries/the-olympic-side-of-london-hd.html",,,,,,,,,,,,2012,,1,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"‘The Olympic Side of London’ is a critical portrait of East London, exploring the transformation of the area from a marginal, working class community to a vibrant cultural hotspot, about to take the world's centre stage. On the eve of the 2012 Olympic Games, the film explores the conflicts and hopes of East Londoners asking: what happens after the Games?

The documentary projects two years of research, encompassing the last sixty years of East London’s history and addresses a number of issues developed in my theoretical work. In particular the film reflects on the problematic relation between factual and fictional elements in documentary filmmaking, challenging the accepted understanding of ‘documentary’ by investigating the intertwining of history and personal memories, document and performance, real experiences and narrative structures, observation and subjective expressiveness. Formally the analysis is developed through the use of archive footage, interviews and narration. The mainstream use of voice-over narration, the 'voice of God' model, which tends to illustrate the image, is here subverted and employed to emphasise the ambiguity of the visual elements. In the film the relationship between sound and image is therefore never a given and the priority of one over the other is renegotiated in each sequence and in each transition, forcing the audience to a number of perceptual readjustments.  

‘The Olympic Side of London’ has been distributed worldwide by Journeyman Pictures and sold to TV channels in countries from Portugal to Hong Kong, in addition to travelling to various festivals, including the ‘London International Documentary Festival’ (lidf.org.uk) and the East End Film Festival. The film also received theatrical release by Artificial Eye / Curzon Cinemas in July 2012.  Articles about the film have appeared in magazines and newspaper in the UK (The Other Side, Londonist), Italy (Il Fatto Quotidiano) and Japan (Sankei Shimbun).

Medium: wood and metal","Arch 402 Gallery, London",,,,,,,,,,,2011,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"‘Mr Big’ generates news ways of thinking about an ancient artistic form - the herm - by examining the symbolic content inherent in male subjectivity in relation to Artaud’s concept of the subjectile (Derrida, ‘The Secret Art of Antonin Artaud’, 1998). The question raised in the research concerns the properties of male subjectivity, and how these properties can be explored through artistic practice. In ‘Mr Big’ this question was addressed through reference to visual metaphors that serve to question the limits of the male subject.

The form references Roman sculptures of Emperors and the ancient Greek herm. The phallic herm is a symbol for territorial demarcation used in ancient Greece, and later adopted by the Romans. Roman sculptures of unpopular emperors were often defaced or remodelled: these are called ‘damned portraits’. This dual property relates to the idea of a figure-head being condemned, whilst also being revered. As a subjectile the research interrogates a specifically masculine subject, elaborated through the metaphor of the father represented through the form of the phallus. Through the articulation of this imagery the sculpture examines an iconic manifestation of a particular representation of symbolic male power. The verticality of the sculpture and its apparent totemic status is contradicted by the furniture tacks nailed to the face, which serve a dual function to both suffocate and to protect.

‘Mr Big’ is a subjectile: it is neither subject nor object because it manifests through its material form aspects of a specific type of male subjectivity that operates in society. The aim of the work is to maintain a presence beyond its material mass, such that the sculpture seems to be a person, a subject. This effect is in part due to the human scale of the work and also to the affective power inherent to the herm-type."

The question draws upon Spinoza’s discussion of the parallelism between mind and body (Spinoza, ‘Ethics’, 1988) and his discussion of the indivisibility of substance. The work also draws on Artaud’s concept of the subjectile, by examining particular subjective difficulties that account for fundamental divisions in the subject’s nature and integrity. This division is held by Freud to emanate from the pregenital period that predates the social, ‘normalised’ subject (Laplanche and Pontalis, ‘The Language of Psychoanalysis’, 1988, p.328). This anarchic stage precedes a later stage of libidinal organisation, in which object relationships develop and cease to have a destructive quality.

The works in ‘What Can a Body Be?’ draw on these ideas to investigate the question of how this ambivalent conceptualisation of the subject might be explored through drawings that challenge the integrity of the human figure. Montage techniques using both found and hand-drawn elements combine to present hybrid figures made from disparate features. The resultant work explores the power that grotesque images can have on the imagination, and how the theory of the subjectile can be effectively elaborated through alternative depictions of the human form.

Since the drawings depict the human form integrated with objects, the relationship between subject and object is literally articulated – thus addressing Spinoza’s notion of unified substance. The works encourage associations between subject and object, and contribute to a long tradition of hybrid depictions of the human form, from Giuseppe Arcimboldo, to Max Ernst and Louise Bourgeois.

The research seeks to generate ways of understanding the concepts of subjectivity and the subjectile through the depiction of a fragmented, but entire, human figure."

",,,,,,,,,,,2009,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"‘On reflection’ investigates the ways in which Artaud’s notion of the subjectile can be interrogated and demonstrated through artistic practice. The work comprises 15 translucent boxes mounted on a wall, each slightly open and containing a mirror angled at 45 degrees allowing contents of the box to be viewed. The boxes include objects, prints, drawings and photographs.

‘On reflection’ explores the planographic aspect of printmaking by presenting objects and flat images on the mirror plane. Through the relationship set up between two-dimensional reflections and three-dimensional objects, the boxes create a visual effect that cannot be photographed, but only experienced through the visual perception of an individual subject. The resulting dialogue between subject and object is intended to encourage reflection of an intimate, secretive type. The materiality of the object, and it’s non-material reflection also address the key distinctions between analogue and digital ‘information’.

The research references the role of the mirror, which reflects a reversed image of an object, and the function of print, which produces an inverted copy from a block or plate. The work initiates a dialogue between reflection and reproduction, which seeks to generate associations between an image that is seen, objectively, and an image that is sensed in the mind, subjectively. Following from this is the reference to the function of imagination, which ‘sees’ a simulacrum of a real object in the ‘mind’s eye’.

The research generates new ways of thinking about the picture plane and the act of perception. It also explores and enters into dialogue with Artaud’s concept of the subjectile because distinctions between subject and object are arguably compounded by the work . The work intends to question how the perception of an object operates once it becomes part of subjective sense perception."

Mixed Media Artwork","Exhiited in the Royal Academy of Arts Summer Exhibition, London, 9 June - 17 August 2010",,,,,,,,,,,2010,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"These works engage with ‘playful optics’ - a reworking of Duchamp’s ‘playful physics’ (see Henderson, ‘Duchamp in Context’, 2005).

The title of ‘Matter and Memory’ is taken from Henri Bergson’s 1896 book of the same name. Drawing on Bergson, the work examines how an object can be presented simultaneously both as a simulation and a physical thing. The view through the glass orb, (which references the mechanism of the human eye) can be viewed as a simulation of subjective perception. The virtuality of this experience is contrasted by the materiality of the sculpture. The work consists of a surgical endoscope (a surgical instrument used to see inside the body used in keyhole surgery) penetrating through an inverted tree trunk. Through the endoscope, viewers see an image of the space around the sculpture, which they perceive to be inverted and refracted in comparison with their experiential memory of that space.

‘Family Tree’ consists of a white box the same scale as the human head. The viewer is required to bend down to look through an eye-shaped aperture cut through the front of the box, to be confronted by their own eye captured and reflected hundreds of times in the multiplying perspectives facilitated by the eccentric properties of the mirrors lining the box. The subject’s perceptions are disturbed by the apparently impossible scale of the box’s interior. The distortion works to generate a sense of subjective ambivalence through the fragmentation of the subject’s reflection. In addition the spatial scale generated inside the box by the multiplying reflections appear incompatible with the physical scale of the box. This ambiguity disturbs normal perceptions of objective reality.

By unsettling the subject’s experience of reality in this way, these works investigate the relationships between optical perception, materiality, and the mental conceptualisation of objects."

The question investigated in Chinese Whispers is what happens to individual and group identity in the process of multicultural and multilingual transmission. These issues have been examined in academic studies which deal with the politics of identity and the conflicts and pressures of cultural translation, particularly when there are hurdles and
blockages in the passing on and exchanging of cultural elements (e.g. attitudes, values, beliefs and behavioural scripts).

These issues interrelate with those of agency and authority. The process of cultural translation is often a fight for supremacy - whose voice is heard, whose is the story, who owns the narrative? This becomes a matter of representation for subaltern, marginalised voices that are without agency because of their social status.

These issues are theorised by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978) and also by Dina Iordanova in Cinema of Flames (2001) and Cinema of the Balkans (2006), and a range of academic approaches to these questions are published in Guha and Spivak’s Selected Subaltern Studies (1988). In contrast to these works the methodology applied in Chinese Whispers was practice-based narrative articulation of the affective aspects of cultural transmission. The essay dramatises the tensions between cultural policy and creative artistic practice; its approach is to show the problems of cultural translation rather than examine them through traditional modes of scholarly discourse.

The new understanding of the problems of cultural translation that is produced in this way gives audiences an alternative insight into issues of cultural transmission - a kind of knowledge that is narrative rather than discursive. This pursuit of the affective dimension of translation gave the essay a unique position among the academic papers given at the ‘Writing in Many Tongues’ Conference at Groningen University, Holland."

The narrator is Sly Peter, a trickster from Macedonian folklore, here imagined as centuries old and a part of the brothers’ mission. The play suddenly moves to Moravia in 867, when the mission was brutally destroyed by Frankish priests. Later Peter returns to contemporary Macedonia in a series of scenes about identity, translation and the clashes between the Latin and Cyrlic worlds.",,,35,False,"The key research questions addressed by Tongues of Fire are what happens to meaning in the process of translation, and how and why it may become obfuscated and lost during transmission. The play investigates the themes of chasms in communication, clashes between different cultures and symbolic orders, and failures of translation.

The play develops an affective articulation of issues of culture and communication that are explored in theoretical texts such as Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies (Hall, 1996) and Is That a Fish in Your Ear (Bellos, 2011). The play’s narrative tackles linguistic and philosophical issues around the translation of the Bible, literary translation, translation as manipulation, intercultural sensitivity, and cultural and linguistic lacunae. It deals with the semantic noise which impairs communication, and which can be caused by a variety of cultural, social, political and psychological factors.

The play also investigates historical events and draws on texts dealing with the cultural and religious clashes between East and West, the Latin and the Orthodox worlds - for example Byzantine Missions Among the Slavs (Dvornik, 1970) and Byzantine Commonwealth (Obolenski, 1971).

The play uses the methodology of practice-based research to articulate the affective aspects of the loss of meaning that occurs in translation. This creates new knowledge by giving audiences and readers an alternative understanding of these issues - knowledge which is often oblique and paradoxical rather than logical and cerebral. As a theatrical narrative the objective of Tongues of Fire is to show the conflict between cultures and symbolic orders and the problems of translation in a dramatic present tense. In this way the play investigates the same issues that are discussed in cultural, political and social forums through academic discourse – in contrast, using dramatic articulation, Tongues of Fire investigates the neglected emotional deep-structure of these issues."
10001143,36,,541884,T,"The Odyssey - a play for the theatre
(wiritten in Serbo-Croat)",,Play ,,,,,,,,,,2012,,0,True,,False,False,,"The play is a subversion of the epic narrative by Homer. The central character is Odysseus, an anti-hero war veteran who is a victim of serious post-traumatic stress disorder. He finds it hard to return ‘home’ and come to terms with himself, his family and the people around him. He is in a state of permanent limbo. The play questions the national stereotypes of ‘home’ and ‘motherland’. It switches the genre and polarity of the narrative from mythological melodrama to tragic farce. It dramatizes the ambiguities of identity, war trauma and repetitive historical cycles of violence.",,,35,False,"In developing the play of Odysseus the key research question was what happens to individual and national identity when it undergoes tectonic historical and political changes. The specific area of investigation was the identity crisis of the population of ex-Yugoslavia after the civil wars of the 1990’s. 

Drama by definition deals with characters out on a limb, fish out of water. The script articulates, in dramatic form, issues of liminality, the convulsive ‘rites of passage’ when social hierarchies become reversed and dissolved, when continuity of tradition becomes uncertain and the future is thrown into doubt. Theoretical texts that analyse these issues are, for example Prologues to Shakespeare’s Theatre – Performance and Liminality in Early Modern Drama (Bruster and Weiman, 2004) and Ritual and Drama as Public Liminality (Turner, 1979). 

The methodology applied was practice-based dramatisation of these issues. It leads to a performance, a showing of these issues on the stage, where they are given affective urgency and immediacy. Using some of the methods of Brecht (alienation) and the theatre of the absurd of Beckett and Pinter (stasis, language as smoke screen) the piece points to the uncertainty of identity, the ambiguity between text and subtext, collision between what seems and what is, contradiction between the spoken and the inferred. 

The theories of affect generally point to visceral forces beneath, alongside, or outside conscious knowledge. The articulation of these forces through drama can serve to drive us toward informed thought and action, and create the possibility of social change. The play offers emotional meaning as a form of new knowledge. It integrates the emotional aspects of meaning with the meaning of emotion, and brings about new insights often neglected by official history or misconstrued by daily politics."

The installation artwork “Smells of Auld Reekie” addresses the question of how the perception of smell might be better understood in terms of our experience of the cityscape, and how this might be represented through mapping and cartographic design.

In Vagueness Gridlocked: Margioles suggests that smells are “notoriously difficult to capture or record” (2006: 110) and research methods in this field remain in the early stages of development. The few existing Smell Maps that have been produced to date focus on scientifically measuring and replicating the smellscape, or locating individual smells through crowd-sourced online mash-mapping. However, whilst maps present a plan view, smells are constructed from a human perspective on the street, creating what “seems to be a contradiction between ‘smelling’ and ‘mapping’” (2006: 110). In developing “Smells of Auld Reekie” my research question addresses how an artwork can combine elements of visual design and smell representation in order that each might augment an understanding of the other in relation to a named city.

The methodology for data collection incorporated smellwalks and interviews with a cross-section of residents conducted within a psychogeography theoretical framework. “Smells of Auld Reekie” is innovative in its use of a combination of original symbology, traditional cartographic design and naturally-occurring smells in the form of bottled scents as the final installation artwork. The new knowledge generated is an insight into the olfactory landscape of the city of Edinburgh and an understanding of the movement and dissipation of smell in that landscape. “Smells of Auld Reekie” is the first visual-olfactive, interpretative map in which the audience contribute to the artwork, thus bringing a human perspective to the mapping and representation of the smellscape."
10001143,36,,707730,Q,"Punctum.
A photographic film which makes use of the snapshot and focuses upon memory and loss",,,,,,,,,,,,2011,https://vimeo.com/39015144,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"This research explores how the potency of the photographic image – specifically the family snapshot – can be regarded not only as a site of memory but also a site of mourning. Drawing upon the filmic and photographic it applies and articulates through practice Roland Barthes’ concept of punctum as discussed in Camera Lucida (1981, reprinted 2000). As Barthes states, ‘A photograph’s punctum is that accident that pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me)’ (2000:27). Punctum examines whether there can be a commonality of viewer emotional response and whether the punctum response, as defined by Barthes, can be triggered through prefabricated vernacular sounds and images. Barthes own exposition has at its rhizome a found photograph of his Mother as a small child; similarly this practice-based research knowingly selects, films and exhibits prefabricated photographs which can readily be generalised by the viewer to those found within family albums.

The research explores this punctum response by articulating through film and image that strange affective dimension at the heart of photography – the idea that the specificity of the photographic medium allows for a paradoxical presentation of a future yet to come (a piercing and wounding quality), as well as the compelling presentation of a moment of the past in the present. The film Punctum creates a sense of nostalgia – including a knowingness of what used to be. Barthes renders this as an awareness of the catastrophe of what is to come, the image being a petit mort – each photograph a tiny death, where the
moment, however joyful or otherwise, has ‘passed’. Through visual stillness (a locked off film camera and prefabricated vernacular photographic images) and the use of demotic sound (aging working class voices) the research offers a manifestation of Barthes’ theorisations and offers insight through a creative exposition of his theory."

Exhibited: John Long - Jorgensen Fine Art, Dublin. 3rd – 21st November 2009",Jorgensen Fine Art Gallery Dublin,,,,,,,,,,,2008,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"This research investigates how different strategies for pictorial isolation are involved in the successful transmission of affect. In the practice there is an ongoing dialogue with aspects of art history in relation to the issue of addressing the question of isolation. The research constructs and composes isolated painterly spaces that allow the spectator to have intense contemplative experiences.

In the history of painting strategies of isolation serve to frame discreet moments detached from ordinary everyday time, allowing painters to creating affective qualities that can be shared with the spectator. There is a force born of the momentary suspension of narrative flow, which can be achieved through arresting time. Isolation is never simply a matter of creating a containing hermetic pictorial space; it is also a matter of bounding that pictorial space within a certain set of controlled and specific art historical resonances and meanings. The research contributes to this ongoing exploration within the history of painting.

Nocturne examines the painterly problem of how the strategies of isolation produce a concentrated transmission of contemplative stillness. Here the isolated figure is posed in an interior at a table in conjunction with a still life arrangement, making references to the genre of domestic interior in Velázquez’s Two Young Men at a Humble Table (1616-17) and Serving Girl with the Supper at Emmaus (1617-18). Nocturne investigates the ways in which this historical genre can be harnessed to create affective resonances within the isolated pictorial space in which the figure is situated. The composition also assimilates Dirck Van Baburen’s The Mocking of Christ (c.1622) through the assonances of line and colour, creating religious overtones. The overall achievement of the piece is to combine narrative, religious and art historical references in order to elaborate a work capable of transmitting an affectivity of silence, stillness and contemplation."

Exhibited: John Long - Jorgensen Fine Art, Dublin, 21st February – 9th March 2013","Jorgensen Fine Art, Dublin",,,,,,,,,,,2011,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"This research investigates how modes of pictorial isolation contribute to the affective qualities of a painting. This piece examines the construction and composition of isolated painterly spaces that generate contemplative experiences for the spectator. When an isolated still life emerges out of the ordinary it can often serve as a means for intensifying the spectator’s perception and sensation of the fleeting moments of life that are submerged within the everyday. This painting elaborates an unnamed condensation of thought and feeling that lies dormant and forgotten within quotidian experience. As an art historical genre, still life attempts to capture the immanent vitality of inanimate objects. It does this by suspending their sensory beauty in an intimate scene, which is intensified by paint and colour. Fleeting and amorphous, this potential lives as a residue in the emergent assemblage of disparate forms and realms of life, be they art historical or natural. Yet it can become palpable as a physical trace in a painting, unifying these objects into one isolated pictorial space. This piece examines the extent to which this is potentially restorative, providing a reconnection between the temporal present, history and the timeless realm of the eternal.

Girl in a Turban II extends the investigation into creative strategies of isolation by developing the theme of figures in conjunction with a still life, in this instance referencing the work of Chardin (especially Still Life with Fruits, c.1763). The figure is bound to these historical affects of still life to elaborate a renewed and intensified sense of contemplative vitality. The piece achieves a close formal relationship of assonant pictorial repetition between the Chardin painting on the wall and the still life on the table that the posed model rests upon, and this isolating strategy is deliberately mobilised as a way of restricting pictorial depth."
10001143,36,,1131353,Q,South East Archive of Seaside Photography,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,http://www.seasphotography.org.uk,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"The genre of the seaside photograph is one that has been neglected in terms of scholarly research. Furthermore it is a genre of photography that has not been well preserved, archived or documented. The South East Archive of Seaside (SEAS) Photography was set up to preserve, and to provide online access to, an extensive collection of these photographs, creating new knowledge through the preservation, archiving, and interpretation of a critically overlooked area of Britain’s cultural heritage. Produced by the Sunbeam Photographic Company between 1913 and 1976, the 40,000 images in the archive’s collection document important aspects of working class and popular culture in the 20th century, recording holidaymakers, entertainers, celebrities and families visiting, living or working in the seaside towns of the Isle of Thanet.

Previously considered unworthy of preservation or study, these photographs present a rich source of data on British social history and visual culture during the heyday of the British coastal resort. Many of the images in the collection are glass plate negatives and fragile ageing film that without preservation would have been lost. Through an online archive the SEAS Photography project seeks to conserve and to provide public access to the visual heritage of British seaside culture. In addition curated exhibitions, workshops, public talks and publications provide contextual and interpretative frameworks for the images, increasing awareness and understanding of a neglected but important part of the UK’s cultural heritage.
This includes work on the representation of children at play, and the seaside as a site for adult display, while interpretative work on pageant photographs investigates the visual articulation of the carnivalesque. In this way, through online access, curation and interpretation, the SEAS Photography archive creates and shares new insights into an overlooked form of popular photography and offers new perspectives on British social history."
10001143,36,,1131354,Q,Echoes of Epstein,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"Echoes of Epstein explores photography’s potential to connote human fragility and mortality. It is a photographic series that investigates the materiality of instant photographic film and through practice responds to both Derrida’s aphorism ‘we owe ourselves to death’ (Athens, Still Remains, 1996) and Epstein’s 1908 British Medical Association sculptures. This research seeks to examine ‘ruination’, relating it to the human form, following conflation of ‘ruination’ and ‘living’ within a common locus. It does so by responding, through photographic practice, to Derrida’s aphorism and the imposed aesthetic of Epstein’s series of sculptures. A number of these sculptures were removed after 1935 and the remainder exist in a ‘ruined’ state on The Strand, London. Thus Epstein’s sculptures have been vulnerable to time, weathering and human interventions, which informed the research into how such vulnerabilities might be translated through photographic imagery of the human form. 

In Echoes of Epstein fragility is made manifest in the medium used to produce the work – instant prototype film – and the associated process of the emulsion lift. Each image in Echoes of Epstein has its own singular identity challenging assumptions of ‘reproducibility’ so common to photography. With Bodyscape I, Bodyscape II and Weakening the Polaroid tagline of an ‘image in an instant’ is overtly rejected in favour of fraught and fragile emulsion lift methods. Individual images are taken from the surface of the original photographic acetate producing fragile translucent slices that are then resituated onto coldpressed paper and, in the Bodyscapes, joined together. The specificity of this film places limitations on the output’s scale and distils each work into a unique artefact in the absence of a negative or digital copy, with consequent ‘flaws’ accepted and expected. The frailty of the images and the uncertainty of the process signal the frailty of the subject, the human body

10001143,36,,1131355,T,Band Apart,,Mixed Media Installation (Photography & Sculpture),,,,,,,,,,2012,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,34,False,"Band Apart is a multimedia installation, which consists of two interconnected pieces: Landscape with Unified Forms, (230mm x 230mm) and Landscape with Fragmented Forms (3810 x 1120mm). The installation is a direct response to the ‘art of the found’, as demonstrated in the work of Kurt Schwitters and Haim Steinbach, and investigates the ways in which found objects are transformed through creative practice. Specifically, the research explores the relationship between photographic images and found objects, making explicit connections between images and objects within a three-dimensional installation. Such
dialogue and interplay between the photographic and the sculptural is unusual, and affords scope for both conceptual and creative innovation.

The installation utilises rubber bands discarded by postal workers during their delivery rounds. The bands were photographed in situ, with each photograph documenting the space around a band, framed by different surfaces and juxtaposed objects. These 1,000 fragmented forms were then randomly allocated by computer to a contained space within a 3810mm x 1120mm frame. The research examines how the creative reappropriation of these humble found objects is able to transcend the prosaic and mundane nature of the materials. This is demonstrated by the ways in which form and colour coalesce as viewing distance from the work increases. Thus, despite the random allocation of the images in Landscape with Fragmented Forms, the multiplicity of forms frequently defragment, demonstrating a range of unintended aesthetic qualities created by our perceptual apparatus. Landscape with Unified Forms is a three-dimensional installation, consisting of the same 1,000 bands formed into a ball and suspended within a resin case. In contrast to the randomised placement seen in its photographic counterpart, the sculpture is a deliberately shaped, intended form. In this way creative dialogue is employed to make explicit connections between sculptural and photographic forms."

It asked where the notion of ‘impartiality’ reporting came from and how it was first implemented. It then explored the line which divides impartial content from opinion and propaganda and how it has been drawn and redefined over the past 80 years. It highlighted that the statutory requirement for impartial journalism was imposed on ITV before the BBC. Through rare archive audio, described as ‘extraordinary’ in a Sunday Times preview, files in the BBC written archive and the National Archives and interviews with distinguished correspondents it charted developments from pre-wartime censorship and disputes between broadcasters and Government to more authored styles of reporting including Martin Bell’s ‘journalism of attachment’.
The programme was the distillation of research from 83 BBC sound files, 282 documents in the BBC Written Archives, National Archives and Churchill College Cambridge and 15 video files in the ITN Archive. (Many more details available.)  Purvis also conducted interviews with Frederick Forsyth, Martin Bell, Sandy Gall and Michael Buerk and extracts - mostly challenges by Purvis as to whether they had ‘crossed the line’ - were included in the programme.
The audio also included a previously untransmitted attack on Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement policy in 1938 by an M.P., Harold Nicolson. He was invited by a newsreel to record his views at the height of the Munich crisis but the film was never shown in any cinema.  Stewart Purvis and Jeff Herbert, archivist, discovered it in ITN’s film archives where a number of newsreels are stored.

I am not a church-goer myself and so it was necessary to spend a year investigating evangelical Christianity, attending services and observing an Alpha course and interviewing young Christian couples. A strand of the novel involves a cell smuggling Bibles into Saudi Arabia and I corresponded with someone who had done just that, reading the personal diaries and documentation from the time. I also spent a commensurate amount of time studying Islam, as one of the two protagonists of the novel is a young Muslim girl. Setting the novel in Bahrain entailed a research trip of a few weeks to the country, investigating the subtle and complex balance of history, politics, race, nationality and religion that underpins a small island state which lies between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, has longstanding ties with Britain and is also home to a significant US military base. The entire process of research and writing the novel took 6 years: a period which indicates the degree of research necessary before I could write confidently, accurately and truthfully about the place and subject matter; and in a way that had literary merit and not just journalistic interest. The novel was published by Faber in Spring 2011. It was serialised for broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s ‘Book at Bedtime’ programme and was awarded the Dylan Thomas Prize for Literature in 2011."

A huge – and fascinating – part of the research was tracking down and interviewing people who had experienced (or even perpetrated) this level of deception.
The novel entailed meticulous research on several other counts. It takes the form of a memoir: at the start of it the narrator, Lara Moorhouse, states her intention to tell the story of her parents and her unusual life.  There was therefore a lot of painstaking research necessary to make the memoir plausible – checking the weather, for example, on certain key dates in the 1970s and the newspaper headlines on specific days – because the reader would have even less tolerance for erroneous detail than in a novel that did not pretend to be anything other than outright fiction.
I also did a lot of reading around the subject of memoir and fiction, trying to understand what the subtle differences (in tone, style, etc.) might be between creative non-fiction and straight fiction and working out how I could incorporate those tones into Lara’s voice and narrative.
A further element of research was into the Northern Irish novel and specifically into how Belfast has been portrayed in fiction throughout the city’s history. The final third of the novel was my attempt to create a present-day portrait of the city and I put a considerable amount of time and effort into reading other Belfast-set works.

The novel was published by Faber in Spring 2013. It was serialised for broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s ‘Book at Bedtime’. It was Belfast’s and Derry/Londonderry’s ‘One City One Book’ choice for May 2013 and was shortlisted for the Kerry Group Irish Novel of the Year."
10001478,36,,2271580,J,"Life and Fate - all episodes (radio drama series adapted for BBC Radio 4, 7 plays of varying lengths (15-, 45- and 60-minutes))",,,,,,,,,,,,2011,http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/posts/life_and_fate_download_keep_an,,False,,False,False,,,,,29,False,"This adaptation of Life and Fate was commissioned by BBC for broadcast in 2011. I worked to adapt it with one other dramatist, Mike Walker, on a 50-50 basis.  The original novel is not written to a standard Dickensian or even Tolstoyan format. We therefore decided to break the narrative into what we called 'Chekhovian short stories'. So the script which follows features 'plays' which cumulatively tell the story by taking discrete groups of characters and relating the narrative only as it concerns them. Mike Walker and I then divided the plays between us – what follows is only the episodes which I wrote alone.
The critical research problem was that the novel was written (though never published) for a Russian readership in the 1960s which would have known considerably more about the Great Patriotic War than a Western audience in 2011. This necessitated considerable background research into the Battle of Stalingrad, the NKVD, the Lubyanka and daily life during wartime Russia. This research was a vital part of fleshing out the story and building the necessary depth into the scenes.
This prompted our decision to pepper the adaptation with 'mockumentary'-style interviews – as though to Grossman himself, for example. This explains the scenes in the script which are described only as 'Interview' and feature only bullet points of information: to give the actor enough information to sound spontaneous, unscripted and as real as possible. Above all, the aim of the adaptation was bring to life a novel which was virtually unknown to British readership at the time.
The adaptation was broadcast in September 2011, on BBC Radio 4, spread across a single week – thus making use of the range of different length drama slots –15, 45 and 60 minutes – that happen to exist in the schedule.

The research task was to update Anthony Trollope’s 1875 novel and show how the financial venality which he sought to expose was just as prevalent in the twenty-first century. Thus the first part of the research process was to find the modern equivalent of the aristocrats-for-sale whom Trollope pillories in his original story. I also had to research the modern equivalent of a railroad – the bogus scheme in which the moneys are invested: after considering a number of different alternatives I settled on Big Pharma and found a company offering an alternative to antibiotics. The next stage of the research was to find the equivalence in how information was disseminated and how reputations could be manufactured. Trollope’s anti-hero required the acquiescence of aristocrats: today’s equivalents are ‘celebs’. Finally, I had to research and analyse Trollope’s style and ensure that the overall outcome remained true to the tone and anger of his prose.
The series was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 15-minute episodes during three weeks of June 2008."

The series is set in a parallel present – different government, exactly the same country and issues. It was never intended to be a comment on or satire of current politicians.  
The research problem was to find issues which were currently of great concern in the UK but which had not recently come to prominence (if they had, the play was likely to turn into a satire of what had happened as opposed to an examination of what might happen).  The research task was then to find a sufficiently urgent way of dramatising the issue so that it would play out within a single day – nearly all the episodes in the series take place within a 24-hour span.
This series of 45-minute plays was broadcast in November 2009.

10001478,36,,2271583,J,"Babylon (Performed at the Rosemary Branch Theatre, 19 September 2013.  Script, programme)",,,,,,,,,,,,2013,,,False,,False,False,,,,,29,False,"Babylon is a full-length play for theatre about the 17th-century prophet, Eleanor Davies. She was a puritan though she did not use that word of herself. Scholars have noted the difficulty of ‘piecing together’ (Porter) the concrete facts of Davies’ turbulent life and world and of understanding her interpretation of events, since the primary source is her dense and cryptic ‘prophetic’ writing. The play involved extensive research using multiple sources combined with much that is invented.

The biographical element was only the preliminary stage of writing the play. Babylon both employs and ruptures the genre of historical epic. In this genre (popularised by Hollywood), historical accuracy is often sacrificed in favour of a larger than life hero, spectacular scenes, a national theme and ambitious historical or religious moments. Some of the scenes in the play provide such moments: the revelatory performance of the deaf-mute boy in the orchard; Davies’ appearance before the High Commissioners; the prison scene in which writing appears on the wall (albeit a digital one); Davies ordaining herself archbishop in Lichfield Cathedral. These scenes are tinged by Davies’ self-dramatising tendencies and verge on the aesthetic excess of which historical epic is sometimes accused (Sobchak). 

Other layers rupture the surface of epic narrative. Both Davies and her ideological opponent Queen Henrietta Maria employ the masque form. We are required to witness Davies’ series of transgressive public roles, culminating in her carnivalesque performance in Lichfield Cathedral and the anti-masque in Bedlam. If this is madness it is ‘social madness’ (Hill), a means of thinking the unthinkable and a mode of expression designed, like her prophecies, to cloak as well as reveal Davies’ political stance. The stance itself was not uncommon in the run up to the Civil War. The subject and mode of expression was and still is."

As a result, the scientist creates a subjective reality based upon the re-interpretation of the processes with which reality is controlled. The irreconcilable conflict of the two realities prevents either from becoming dominant.

It is set in East London’s Royal Docks, a regeneration zone where City Airport, the Excel Exhibition Centre and new housing developments are interspersed with the historic communities of Silvertown and North Woolwich. The population includes many who are new to the area, among them dockside development residents, children and newly arrived immigrant groups. Drawing on multiple local voices rather than a single expert, the project encourages local people to explore the area, reflect on their local/global heritage and psychologically ‘ungate’ sites through their incorporation as trail locations. Butler made a point of involving local residents—especially young people—in the design and delivery of the trails in order to encourage them to build an empathy with their surroundings.
The project draws on Butler’s theoretical work on the empathetic experience of listening to oral history on location, including ‘Teaching and Learning Guide for Memoryscape: How Audio Walks Can Deepen Our Sense of Place by Integrating Art, Oral History and Cultural Geography’, Geography Compass, 2, 5, 2008, 1750–54, and Butler (co-author with Miller), ‘Linked: A Landmark in Sound, a Public Walk of Art’, in Perks, Robert, and Alistair Thompson (eds.), The Oral History Reader, Routledge, 2006, 425-433). It went on to inform ‘The Historical Hearing Aid’, included as Output 2. The Heritage Lottery Fund (£50,000), Tate and Lyle (£4,000) and the Royal Docks Trust (£23,000) funded the project. Butler’s role included bid authorship, project design, selection of artists, volunteer training, output publication and authorship and website design.

Set in Belchite Spain, a medieval town ruined during a three-week civil war battle, its experiments with the evocation of a traumatic past-in-the-present were informed by research trips to Belchite and extensive research on the Civil War. The film’s fictional dialogue draws on researched first-hand accounts from the war's witnesses and participants, including members of the International Brigades, which were utilized in the creation of fictionalized characters. Daniels' research into the temporalities of trauma and films that engage with memory and trauma are reflected in the film's non-linearity, with its construction of time collapsed into simultaneity, as well as the creation of  “a specific tone of a past […] as a continuing present” (Cowie, 2011). Not Reconciled's experimentation expands on the cinematic language of realist documentary by foregrounding place and fictional performativity to challenge the accepted role of the interview and narration in documentary film. Its sound includes minimal non-diegetic industrial noise aiming to evoke a sense of continuing displacement and loss. Daniels’ production company High Ground Films funded its £10,000 budget. See Daniels Output 3 for a more detailed description of her research imperatives."

Grounded in 'memory work' (Kuhn 1995) and in Daniels' reflections on continuing influences including Akerman, The Border Crossing's experiment in documentary works across borders, interrogating relations between autobiography, place and traumatic memory. The film's form assumed its shape during a research journey of discovery to the location of a violent attack Daniels suffered many years ago. Informed by research into traumatic temporality and the traumatic past's 'absolute discontinuity' from the present (Greene 2000: 247), the film's soundtrack juxtaposes the voice of a speaking 'I' located in the present with the voice of a girl, Siân, representing that 'I's' younger self. Between them these voices explore memories of a journey, reflecting on the fragility of memory and the continuing affects of violence and loss. Research into theories of traumatic realism (Rothberg 2000; White 1996) inform the film's deferral of narrative closure as a means to encourage reflection on the unreliability of memory and the nature of the past. As research, the film’s positioning between the personal and the social, fiction and documentary, realism and reflexive enactment aims to produce new knowledge of the discontinuities between past and present and to explore gendered subjectivity at the interface of personal and the social. This film was part-funded through Daniels' film production company, High Ground Films Ltd. UEL awarded the film £2,000 (through its early career researcher fund) and the filmdirecting4women film festival awarded materials to an approximate value of £4,000."

Black Sun is their second album and is an example of the electronic genre from South London referred to as dubstep. Goodman is a recognised pioneer of the sound, which he took forward on his debut album, Memories of the Future, also recorded with Gordon. Working as a practitioner and a cultural theorist, Goodman understands his production work along with his regular DJing appearances to be an articulation of the affective politics he writes about in Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect and the Ecology of Fear, where he outlines an original analysis of the politics of frequency. With the electronic music of the black diaspora generating an alternative and perhaps even oppositional form of sound and sociality, Goodman continued to contribute to the dance movement that gathered around dubstep with the release of Black Sun. On the album he deepened his exploration of Afro-futurist sound by placing greater emphasis on mid-range frequencies than had been the case with dubstep’s earliest releases, which were dominated by bass and percussion. The innovation contributed to dubstep’s reinvention of itself, which in turn helped it remain true to the organic dance network that had shaped it in the first place. In practice-theory terms, the proponents of dubstep had avoided capture by maintaining their level of sonic innovation and demonstrating that they were in control of their destiny. Goodman released Black Sun on Hyperdub, his acclaimed record label, which also helped pioneer dubstep. The album booklet includes a graphic novel-style text written by Goodman and Gordon, illustrated by Raz Mesinai."

Butler was awarded a £5,000 budget to research and develop an oral history-based memoryscape on the basis of his experience in combining sounds, interviews and archive recordings to make innovative trails for the Museum of London and Elmbridge Borough Council (discussed in Outputs 1 and 2). These came to the attention of the museum and heritage sector following publication of Butler’s article ‘Memory Lane: How to Produce Trails for MP3 Players That Give Listeners an Evocative Experience of Place’, Museum Practice, 40, 2007, 42-45.
The trail research consists of archival research (both documentary and audio), soundscape recordings and a series of oral history interviews with over a dozen local residents, park users and employees. Butler’s role was to direct the project, research and write the script, and conduct some of the oral history interviews, working closely with Gibson. Content-wise the trail had to cover a significant range of historical material. It also had to work when listened to in any direction or order. Where possible the less visible and less well-known but locally significant aspects of park life were included through the voices of the interviewees. The trail is available for free download and players can be borrowed from the park's visitor information centre.

Research questions include: How is our idea of vision and the act of seeing or visualization altered through the influence and reliance on (digital) technological apparatus? Through practical application and presentation, how might it be possible to re-conceptualize our notion of vision and ‘seeing’ via material and technological mediation? The exhibition arose from work produced for MOSI’s ‘Art-Machine-Vision’ exhibition (2007). The representation and refinement of the works further developed ideas about the relationship between art and technology, included ‘live’ video interaction, single- and multi-screen video, and adapted commercial technologies. Works aimed to provoke ideas, responses and reactions to the way we engage with digital technologies as well as the notions of ‘seeing’. Two works were completed, aligning with the exhibition’s central investigation and theme: 1. Magnification - asked visitors to consider the way viewers understand and interact with digital technologies as objects/artefacts. Viewers were invited to observe a series of 3-D CGI animations, presented on small digital displays, via non-digital magnification lens. Through the reinvention of everyday technologies and the re-presentation of familiar materials, the aim was to generate disharmony between material and expectation; 2. Interactive Eyes - responded to perceived notions of artificial intelligence and our desire to connect with the digital machine. Using the distorted form of the human eye to track movement, these eight separate works create a pseudo-interconnected community, parodying the concept of artificial life and the intelligent machine. The project enhances understanding of how we use digital technologies to augment our activity of viewing and reexamine the role that technology plays in visualizing the world around us. Workshops associated with the exhibition discussed the ideas and explained the production."

By focusing on one of the central issues raised in the creation of digital images - the much-debated relationship between simulation, representation and presentation - this research investigates the relationship between photo-realistic (and non-photo-realisitc) CGI human representation and our ability to engage with, or to understand, what we perceive as being real. Research questions included: How can 3-D CGI technology be employed as an art form and as a means to mediate and visually convey social perspectives or abstract ideas relating to realism? How can abstract form be used to explore relationships between identity, culture and technology? The relationships between viewer and the work, and access to the work by the viewer (through display) were fundamental to this project which draws on phenomenological debates relating to delivery and perception. The work ‘Self Portrait’, produced for the ‘Projection Reflection’ exhibition explores these concerns. Employing multiple screen projection and contrasting animated imagery, the work sought to place the viewer within a space designed to encourage questions relating to portraiture and the self, and to re-examine preconceived notions about representation, process and digital 3D computer animated image. Via practical application this research aims to interrogate concepts of the real through an investigation into alternative 3D digital animation methods, practice and presentation and the use of ‘embodied’ expression, abstraction and interaction, as opposed to visually photo-realistic and purely representational forms. In positioning and designing content of the animations in this way, viewers reflect on the nature, content, construction and materiality of the works of representation and portraiture."

It develops previous research where space has been discussed as material (within 3-D CGI). By presenting space as qualitative material within three-dimensional computer-generated animation, opportunities may emerge to reassess the function and mode of 3-D CGI as a medium. Research questions included: How might space be qualified as material, within the context of three-dimensional computer-generated animation, through practical application and analysis? Can space in relation to the production and construction of 3-D CGI animation be regarded as a fundamental property within this mode? This project complements work being developed in both theoretical and practice-based research on 3-D CGI animation. Debates concerning the nature and potential of digital formats provide a basis for such work. The application of space in research into stereoscopic cinema, or research of the ‘virtual camera’, potentially offers points of crossover and integration. The work emerges from similar practice produced by artists and animators that explore the boundaries of material and 3D CGI, e.g. Gerrard, Hentschlager and Kurokawa. To address the questions, the project adapts a theoretical model based on structural/materialist filmmaking, and a practical method acquiring supporting evidence through exhibition and formal discussion. Its uniqueness and originality lie within its aspiration to redefine the material understanding of 3-D CGI animation and its relationship with space. In related research the idea of ‘space’ has appeared as a constructional, presentational, abstract and illusionary tool. It has been integrated previously into discussions surrounding 3-D CGI but not taken a central place within the medium or considered as a material, embodying its own qualities. This research establishes space as possessing unique qualities and properties, and distinct constructional and communication values within the realm of 3-D CGI. The project was part of the ‘LOGIC 11 exhibition."

The research represents a study of ‘space’ within the production and presentation of 3-D CGI animation.  It aims to build upon and expand its implied associated visual language, and to investigate our perception of 3-D CGI, our understanding of it as a medium and our expectation of its application. Research questions include: Can the conceptualization and presentation of space be deemed as fundamental to the language of three-dimensional computer-generated animation, and defined as material? Within the boundaries of 3-D CGI animation is it possible to establish a set of properties that defines space as a material and its ability to provide a unique form of communication? This project is informed by dialogues concerning the digital in texts such as ‘Digital Materialism’ by van den Boomen, Lammes, Lehmann, Raessens and Schäfer. It also draws upon artists/filmmakers/animators working within this medium who explore the nature of 3-D CGI space, e.g. O’Reilly, Payne, and Fleisch. The principal mechanism for addressing these concerns has been a combination of practical and theoretical research. The project’s theoretical framework arises from structural/materialist filmmaking, reworking three imperatives: an anti-narrative, anti-illusionist approach to filmmaking; the documenting/recording of process to instigate a definition of material; the presentation of process in an attempt to suppress meaning and to deny the viewer a sense of illusionistic space within the frame of the work.  The work generates interesting dialogues on the function and form of 3-D CGI, its position as a process for animation and medium for communication. Feedback from the exhibitions/artist talks acknowledges that the approach and application of this research has engendered a greater understanding of the processes and potentialities of 3-D CGI as a medium, as well as generally supporting the hypothesis, space as material."

It addresses two distinct research questions:

1)	How can digital technologies enhance archival footage to inform public knowledge and awareness of 1970s and 80s cultural history in Birmingham?
2)	To what extent did distinct musico-ethnic genres influence each other in a period of profound multicultural change in England’s second city?

The research imperative is part of a wider evaluation of regional music identities in the period. The immediate context is provided by documentary films such as Oil City Confidential (Julien Temple, 2009) which deals with Dr Feelgood, and The Beat is the Law (Eve Wood, 2011) which deals with the Sheffield music scene. Carefully marshalled by Shannon, who ran the film creatively, research was undertaken on Birmingham’s popular music history, including interviews and the retrieval of archival material for inclusion in the narrative.

Shannon’s film presents the case for Birmingham’s musical and ethnic hybridity, using the filmic techniques of the Film Workshop Movement, and revisiting his earlier film Motor City Music Years (1982), intercutting contemporary interviews with the surviving protagonists, with footage digitised from the local archives. His contribution was to devise the structure, identify the genres to be studied and to choose the contributors, combining oral history with expert testimony.

Funded by the UK Film Council (Digital Archives Fund), the project's principal contributions to knowledge are the digital curation of ephemeral film footage, now made available to a wide audience, and the application of theory from Stuart Hall’s Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, in which Shannon received his educational formation."
10007823,36,,2427981,Q,Scape,,Australian International Experimental Film Festival ,,,,,,,,,,2010,http://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/5520/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"Scape, a seven-minute digital moving image piece, examines the way in which architecture and geography can be subsumed into a suggestible surface of abstraction, with the still image being used in terms of the moving image to become a space which dissolves the distinction between the real and the imagined.  In practice, Scape develops a versatile flatness that shifts in its exploration between modernist surface and the visual interface of post-modernity, as the specific aspect of the contemporary city is conveyed (transported) through multiple layers of the architecture of the imagination.  

Research questions: 
How can still images as moving images deconstruct the three dimensional built environment into images of flatness?  
How does this process re-construct a critical sensibility toward the concrete, rationalized spaces of urban cartography as mediated through digital photography?  

Research context: Scape is informed by the Situationist experimentation of Joyce, Murdoch, Gysin, Sommerville, Burroughs and Sinclair, yet it responds creatively to Keenan’s (2009) concept of hypnagogic music as exemplified by Philip Jeck, The Caretaker, Broadcast and The Focus Group.  Like hypnogogic music, which takes existing cultural artefacts and transforms them into new aural landscapes, Scape transforms original digital photographs from the London Underground and Berlin U-Bahn and sounds from Berlin’s Hauptbanhof into sequences of moving images, which were developed into complex visual and aural layers.  Using images of light sources, Scape explores how our relationship to our surroundings can be re-mapped.  Scape has been screened at various prestigious film festivals, including The Collectif Jeune Cinema Festival of Experimental Cinema in Paris, The Lausanne Underground Film & Music Festival in Switzerland, Da Fest Digital Art Festival held at the National Academy of Art in Sofia Bulgaria, and the Berlin Directors’ Lounge. Scape has gained a couple of awards including second prize at Videoholica Film Festival (2013). "
10007823,36,,2427982,Q,Overpass,,Punto y Raya Festival,,,,,,,,,,2011,http://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/5522/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"The research imperative was to investigate practically the digital screen as surface and how images move across the screen.  
Research questions included: 
How can the digital screen and its flatness as surface in terms of architecture be understood? 
How does the movement of an image across a digital screen and the sequential process it goes through relate to the flatness of the screen? 
How can the architecture of spectatorship in terms of this digital flatness and surface be framed? 

Research Context: Modernist painting can be seen as an investigation into the structure of the material through analysing surface by way of canvas and paint and considering the nuances of flatness. Video art continues this investigation in texts ranging from the structuralist films of Sharits, Jacobs, Kubelka, and Raban to the more recent digital productions of Takeshi Murata, Telcosystems, and Makino Takashi. For instance, Makino's practice, which includes Into Your Star (2011) and 2012 (2012) uses abstraction to scrutinize screen space, here redefined as a flattened image surface that engulfs our peripheral vision. ‘Overpass’ is situated within this tradition, though its use of digital rather than film sources extends the scope of investigation in terms of the temporal-spatial possibilities of the flatness of the screen.  Manipulating a piece of found digital footage, ‘Overpass’ is a four minute moving image that explores and questions what is flat and how depth is created by way of a digital surface.  Findings were disseminated by both screening the work as part of an exhibition, ‘NODE 10, Forum for Digital Arts, Frankfurt (http://node10.vvvv.org/pages/exhibition), 2010, and as part of a series of artist talks and feedback activities at Cornerhouse, Manchester 2012; FACT, Liverpool 2013; and Edge Hill Arts Centre 2013."

It was also installed at Khoj International Artists’ Association, New Delhi (2013) and at Rutgers, Caribbean Sounds Conference (2013), and discussed in J. Henriques, “Hearing Things and Dancing Numbers” Theory, Culture & Society, 29 (4/5) 2012. 

The research aim of the sculpture is to provide qualitative evidence, in the form of listeners’ questions and written comments, on how auditory shapes and images are recognized in the “mind’s ear.” This is a practical way of testing some of the ideas and findings on the Jamaican reggae dancehall music scene, reported in Sonic Bodies. Both book and sculpture are concerned with embodied, and often tacit, ways of knowing. Derived from auditory – rather than visual – sensation, they provide useful examples of haptic understanding, as audition often escapes representation. Thus the research methodology calls for an exploration of acoustic space, as distinct from its visual counterpart, to explore how far geometry might be understood through the enminded body, rather than the more traditional mathematical or disembodied mind. 

The sound sculpture is performed within a 360-degree 3D auditory field produced by 12 channels of high quality sound, whose output is configured to fill the room. Within this sound field, using state-of-the-art software, it is possible to specify the position of up to 16 sound sources and control their travel anywhere in this space (plus their conventional parameters: pitch, volume and timbre). Thus shapes can be “drawn” in sound (like a sparkler firework draws in light) in the 3D space in which the listener is immersed. The geometrical shapes of the sculpture included circles the topological figures of the Borromean Knot and the Torus (Donut). The sculpture sensitized listeners to sound as a creative medium. "

1. She has developed the overall data model for the project. This has meant selecting the standards to store the data; choosing which features of the data (and particularly of manuscripts) were worth annotating in order to fulfil the goals of the project; customizing the standards employed in order to adapt to the particular needs of the project. These activities have lead to interactions with the standards’ developers (in particular the Text Encoding Initiative), resulting into a substantial modification of the standards themselves. 
2. She has provided training and guidance in the editorial work. She has developed the framework within which the encoders have worked and supervised the data entry.
3. In accordance with the PI requirements, she has designed the website (www.janeausten.ac.uk), its functionality, and its behaviour. In coordination with the technical developers she has also determined the choice of the technologies used by the website.

In addition to these, she also served as project manager for the last two years of the project.

The aim of the series is to provide the first scholarly edition of Cobden’s letters, annotated to the highest possible standards.  The text of each letter has been faithfully transcribed, including original errors and erasures.  Full use has been made of the new availability of digitised sources to provide a level of detailed annotation almost impossible to achieve in earlier letter editions.  The editors have endeavoured to include the full range of Cobden’s political activities, as well as to give a flavour of his business interests and domestic life.  The selection also reflects the full extent of Cobden’s national and international networks, including important correspondences with American, French and Italian Liberals.  Priority has been given to previously unpublished letters and those where the originals reside in remote archives.

The range of texts is designed to illustrate the cultural and social impact of social norms on the science of medicine. The selection ranges from material which is effectively in the ‘conduct-book’ genre (Eliza Warren’s How I Managed My Children from Infancy to Marriage; Lionel Weatherly, The Young Wife’s Own Book) to scientific text books (Kelly’s Medical Gynaecology). In making her selection, however, the editor wanted to show how shifts in attitudes towards women’s emancipation had major effects even on what appear to be scientific texts. She also sought to demonstrate the difference it makes when professional women doctors (Mary Scharlieb, Mary Puttnam Jacobi) and scientists came on the scene to speak about their own health on their own behalf. The collection is in five volumes. The texts are reproduced as facsimiles of their original publication. Their collection involved substantial research in a range of medical archives including the WellcomeTrust library and the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester.

Therefore the issue of whether to dub or subtitle films has to be addressed. Audiences are averse to attending subtitled films, yet in research carried out by Roberts and Stephen Hay (University of Leeds) focus group participants expressed an emotional rejection of any ‘dubbing’. It is food for thought that we could greatly increase the prospect of facilitating audience reception to dubbing if we sought to create a more visual, less verbally driven, even more cinematic medium. 
The strategies for film-makers considered by Roberts and Hay have mainly (but not exclusively) focussed on avoiding shooting sync. dialogue in close-ups. Dramatic close-ups are still usable, but in the case of dialogue, might work best as reaction shots, again pushing the medium towards a less literary, less dialogue dependent, more visually driven narrative form. Our aim, as well as making ‘dubbing’ more palatable for audiences, is to discourage formulaic scene construction and encourage inventive, less predictable mise-en-scene. 
Roberts and Hay have run a number of showings/focus groups focussing on this issue over the last decade. The recent ‘Malentendu’ (meaning ‘misunderstanding’ in French) project has built upon this knowledge gained and centred on the following research aims: exploring subtitling and dubbing technique; utilising practice as a research tool; increasing the prospect of facilitating audience reception to dubbing; and creating a more visual, less verbally driven, even more cinematic medium. 
The three films (posted on our Vimeo account at the beginning of 2013) exhibit
a)	A ‘French language’ short film scripted and shot to enable us to complete c)
b)	A ‘traditionally’ subtitled version
c)	A dubbed version which aims to illustrate our research aims (above)"

Megan Parks 'Lucy'",,,,,,,,,,,,2009,http://vimeo.com/rainfallpictures/videos ,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"‘Words to Music’ is a short (23 minute) fiction film project based on a 20-page script, uniquely involving the participation of a performer with profound multiple disabilities including severe communication difficulties. The project (executive produced by Graham Roberts) set out to afford full engagement in film production process to a player from a client group virtually absent from the screen by virtue of disability level. In doing so, it aimed to create a positive image of severe disability on screen. The production process was documented (via the accompanying documentary ‘Megan Parks: ‘Lucy’’) to further disseminate the key production learning involved and to share with film industry professionals and others working professionally with severe multiple disability. The research content of the piece(s) centres on production practice:
a)	in relation to performers with communications issues;
b)	engaging with previously excluded client groups;
c)	managing a project which gave a first professional film credit to recent graduates;
d)	sowing seeds for maintaining links and developing collaboration between university and film industry, to the benefit of our students and alumni.
‘Lucy’ documents the production process we developed to deal with a, b and c (above) whilst ‘Words to music’ serves as proof of concept. There was wide interest and support for the project, including President of the UK Rett Syndrome Association, President of the International Rett Syndrome Foundation, alongside many Rett parents and carers.
The production (managed by Roberts) took place in early 2009. The first screening was: Selby Town Hall (July 2009). Further screenings took place at: Rett UK Conference (Oct 2009); and International Rett Syndrome Association (IRSA) (Nov 2009). The film(s) were further disseminated through the website http://www.rettsyndrome.org/"

The special issue emerged in response to the public outcry caused in January 2007 by the Celebrity Big Brother race row involving the reality TV star Jade Goody and the Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty. The show triggered an unprecedented number of complaints to the regulator Ofcom. The theme of the special issue is ‘Governing Celebrity: Multiculturalism, Offensive Television Content and Celebrity Big Brother 2007’. Its contribution lies in the fact that it brought together leading scholars from the media studies field of celebrity and reality television (Holmes and Redmond) and the socio-legal field of media governance and regulation (Gies, Thomas and Varney). While each of these fields is inherently interdisciplinary, they have remained stubbornly insulated from each other. The special issue facilitated a dialogue across these specific disciplinary boundaries, with contributors approaching the topic from the perspective of the consumption politics of race (Thomas), the issue of class and celebrity déclassement (Holmes), Britain’s elusive human rights culture (Gies), the mediation of the Other through food rituals (Redmond) and the specific regulatory framework in which Ofcom operates (Varney). The special issue provides a very good illustration of the kind of interdisciplinary synergies that are needed to put celebrity on the research agenda across the humanities and the social sciences."

This chapter centrally employs the concept of creolization as theorised by Édouard Glissant, which highlights the power of community building and creativity arising from imperialism, without glossing over the horrors of transatlantic enslavement. It also considers key theories from humour studies, arguing that humour, like creolization, calls for a politically revolutionary stance, disruptive of the status quo maintaining hierarchies of privilege. Creolization and humour are employed to explore how innovative artist interventions in Europe and the USA may open the museum to new, ‘difficult or hard to reach’ audiences aged 15-25years, and also rejuvenate the experience of regular visitors"

•	The functionality has been engineered in response to the research and performance needs of 49 partners through three EU integrated projects, one EU STREP project, one JISC/NSF funded project, along with two national services, running simultaneously
•	Ongoing innovation has been required since the research was initiated in 2008 to meet the emerging demands in both scale and complexity of big data
",,,,,False,"Cheshire3 is an information retrieval system researched, developed, and published as an independent software product at the University of Liverpool during 2008-2013, as a complete redesign and reimplementation of the previous Cheshire digital library system, using an object model that enables Grid-based information retrieval over the data grid. The research was funded by the EU, the JISC, NSF, and Research Councils. 

It is designed to meet the following needs:-

•       Effective real-time retrieval from petabyte-scale collections. 
•       Efficient retrieval from large scale, globally distributed, heterogeneous collections. 
•       The need to integrate data and text-mining with storage, curation and retrieval. 

The system implements a “meta-search” capability to build combined indexes “harvested” from distributed sources. Statistical ranking methods are used to rank servers or databases by the probability that they contain relevant information for a given user query. This capability can be recursively executed, which radically improves retrieval performance and efficiency. 
Cheshire3 incorporates innovations emerging from the research programme, including:
•       Updated ‘metasearch’ techniques, formally evaluated using real-time searching of large-scale document datasets. 
•       Research advances in indexing and term extraction for automatic classification of database records, using blind relevance feedback during augmented second stage search. 
•       Data and text mining, digital library tools. 
•       Integration of computational and data grids, including the integrated Rule Oriented Data System, to provide scalable retrieval.
 •       A staged logistic regression algorithm, and other algorithms, which form the basis of search and merge of results sets and ranks documents by relevance. 
•       Blind relevance feedback to enable cross-language and patent retrieval, as assessed in formal evaluations (Cross Language Evaluation Forum, the INEX Evaluation Initiative)

Cheshire3 is used internationally in production services for searching archives of science data, and in multiple digital library services including the Archives Hub, and the British Library.

Work at Liverpool on the Multivalent digital object model began in 2005.  From 2008 to 2013 the software was extensively redesigned with extensions, and integrated into the iRODS data preservation system. 

 The engineering challenge was to develop generic parsing technology that could analyse and display meaningful information derived from diverse data objects in a way that is independent of the storage system and that would remain viable far into the future.

The research innovation is a platform-independent virtual machine for interpreting scientific or document data in terms of essential attributes, meaningful structures, relationships, or visual representations. The approach captures the essential attributes of science and document data, and retains it within the archival system and so preserves the ability to interpret and manipulate such digital entities, even within global scale data systems.

The approach allows the viewing and manipulation of documents or other data objects held in any storage infrastructure. This has been demonstrated by using Multivalent / Fab4 software to support different document, media, and CAD formats, serving as the object virtualisation layer. The model also provides augmented annotation capability. This supports shared distributed annotations that are semantically anchored, enabling them to be applied across formats. 

The software forms the foundation of multiple international projects, including EU Integrated Projects (SHAMAN, PrestoPrime), the US National Archives (NARA) Transcontinental Persistent Archive Prototype for archiving Congressional records, and the NSF funded DataNet program.

PYRODS allows researchers to design and execute flexible processing sequences that represent complex data analysis. These steps can be archived for later use (“reproducible science”), either to verify experimental results or to create new data products. PYRODS also provides a GUI to allow any level of user from a variety of disciplines to design these workflows in a drag-and-drop manner. 

The research innovation consists of a model to implement preservation processes as virtualised workflows, with the data and workflow steps stored in archived collections for reuse or verification. The implementation required optimisation of management processes across different levels of abstraction and a modular structuring of workflow execution. 

PYRODS is designed to meet the following needs for reproducible science :

•	The software design and structure arises from this need for an environment that supports the sharing, adaptation and automated re-execution of workflows for the conditioning, reduction and analysis of research data.
•	Interoperable workflows that support re-usable and adaptive procedures for data management in scientific collaborations;
•	The need to integrate multiple executable scientific workflows and storage workflows, thus removing infrastructure dependencies; 
•	The need to be able to share and re-execute scientific workflows with minimal intervention; 
•	The need to be able to save the workflows as digital objects in the data grid to be read or modified in the future.

PYRODS is used internationally for executing processing workflows as part of archival systems in many services, including Sanger Institute, IN2P3, and NASA.

The work (first published in 2000 as Media Ethics and Self Regulation) includes an up-to-date overview of the significant social, political and media activity leading to changes in media regulation in the UK and Ireland throughout the first decade of the 21st century. This output is based upon a systematic research led review of these extensive contemporary changes to media regulatory systems, adding approximately 65,000 words to the volume. This additional material includes analyses of key cases in reputation and privacy in the ethics section of the book (Chapters 6 and 7) and quantitative research data and analyses in the regulation section (Chapters 13 to 20). The regulatory section of the output introduces new empirical research into UK and Irish regulatory bodies.  This section continues and develops Frost’s analysis of systems of press regulation by both government and industry in the UK and Ireland. These new chapters provide one of the first quantitative analyses of the complaints performance of Ofcom, the Press Complaints Commission and the Irish Press Council.  The section also contains qualitative comparative analyses of the structural efficiency and effectiveness of these regulators."

Methods included using iambic pentameter and rhyme, at times this form echoing the author’s constraints at being detained and treated without consent, at others allowing her to search for unexpected rhymes and convey natural rhythms in counterpoint to a baseline beat, to transmit unrequited love, or pity for the homeless and suicides.  Imagery, symbols, metaphors, similes and allusions were matched to content, mood and music to render life inside a psychiatric hospital as A Knowable World. 

This book relates to the poet’s earlier books, Fields Away (2003), Score! (2005) and Beyond (2013) which together narrate an insider’s view of mental illness and its management.  Form, especially iambic pentameter and the sonnet, remains an ongoing area for this poet’s inquiry and practice and has relevance for poets who wish to practice these devices and for academic critics. A distinctive feature is that many of these poems were written while the poet was acutely manic in hospital.  The book makes an original contribution, within a canon that goes back to John Clare and Ivor Gurney, of poets writing from mental distress, and can be read alongside Lowell and Plath for its poetic examination of bipolar illness, by literary critics of madness, such as Gordon Claridge, theorists such as those from Freud to Foucault, social historians such as Roy Porter, and psychological creativity researchers like Anthony Storr."
10004351,36,,385226,A,Beyond,,Bloodaxe Books,,,,,,978-1780370972,,,,2013,http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1780370970,,False,,False,False,,,,,29,False,"This collection asks, ‘How can techniques of imagery and sound best convey spiritual and emotional progress from despair, isolation and loneliness to optimism, effort and hope?’; and ‘How can London be rendered a universal symbol of life’s harsh realities, yet also of human love and compassion?’

The poems demonstrate how methods of metaphor and simile, sonnets with their volta, and couplets, quatrains and iambic pentameter with its reassuring beat, transmit how life can be rebuilt from an outlook of negativity and despair to an included and inclusive view of the world. Through changes of register, from prayer and lament to upbeat rhetoric and love poetry, Beyond narrates, via the musical movement and epiphany of each poem and via multiple representations of London and the rural, a journey out of depression to a place of renewed spirit and passion.

This book continues its author’s earlier examination (e.g. in A Knowable World 2009) of mental states and preoccupations of finding music and imagery to transmit observation and experience.  Its audiences would include, especially, creative writers seeking a lesson in poetic imagery and form, academics researching psychological analysis and literary expression, those interested in female writing that engages with traditionally male canonical forms, and by general readers for its spiritual journey from a negative atheism to a positive humanism.

The work is located in mainstream modern lyric poetry from Edward Thomas and Frost through Larkin and Heaney to Douglas Dunn, Simon Armitage and Don Paterson, yet represents a revision and reassessment of this style through its female perspective, a metropolitan as well as a rural focus, the author’s knowledge of other mental states, and allusions and techniques borrowed from ancient drama, rhetoric and philosophy. It represents an original contribution to poetry, London writing, psychological analysis and the literature of the human condition.

The work also explores the influence of text on visual practice.

It responds to the following research questions: How can the conceit of the ‘alternative patron saint’ be elaborated and augmented over a collection of poems? What range of form and style can be used to capture the essence of imaginary saints (or their ‘charges’) in order to ‘tell all the truth, but tell it slant’ over a range of contemporary issues? How does the combination of text and illustration create new sites for engagement with poetry?

These poems began with the deliberate identification of a contemporary issue to be explored through the concept of the Patron Saints. Refining and reshaping through this lens led to a discovery that the constriction of the conceptual frame paradoxically led to a freedom of approach and voice.

This multimodal collaboration involved a group of artists who drew direct interpretation from the text as a source, gaining a sense of ownership of the poetry.

The poetry draws on the narrative/ lyric mode of Hardy; traditional Lives of the Saints; religious poetry ranging from George Herbert to R.S. Thomas -  in turn echoing the cadences of the King James Bible - and blends these with the  humour and accessibility of Cope, Collins and Duffy to mine controversial issues.

The concept of an illustrated hagiography draws on the long history of illustrated manuscripts, on the author’s own work as a film-maker, on collections by poets including Oswald and Sloboda working with one illustrator, on a deliberate reversal of the increasingly common practice of ekphrastic poetry, and harks back to the tradition of the illustrated fresco, the biblical text made familiar through its expression in paint.

10004351,36,,1701636,T,Investigation of Lakanal House Fire,,"TV, radio and online broadcasts",,,,,,,,,,2013,,,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This output consists of a sustained (2009-2013), longitudinal, regional television news investigation (BBC London) in the wake of the fatal Lakanal House fire in Southwark, London.
	The underpinning process is innovative as it demonstrates how investigative journalism can flourish at a time when the cost base across all platforms, especially local, is being severely eroded and the BBC’s own budgets for daily, regional news programmes are under tremendous strain, severely curtailing investigations.
	There is a single narrative arc comprising 38 original broadcast stories, demonstrating how the use of collaborative networks to help facilitate frequent and habitual sharing of information within the context of a systematic use of ‘crowd-sourced’ or ‘citizen journalism’ helped to feed the story over time.
	Uniquely, this investigation was given exposure over a four-year period and matured into an in-depth exposé of flawed decision-making processes in local government, compliance with the law, construction of the tower block, the building’s refurbishment, and the conduct of emergency services from reporting to fighting the fire. This story was widely ignored by other media outlets whilst Barling’s networked research and meticulous scrutiny of public records revealed for the first time the way public authorities were ignoring fire risks and laws governing their public responsibilities.
	It considers whether this style of investigation could support television journalism’s ability to hold power to account irrespective of shrinking budgets, by identifying news processes that might help preserve quality in a downward cost-driven environment where both time and money are scarce.
	This research is located within a large body of critical evaluations of the state of regional investigative broadcast journalism in the UK. (Barnett, 2010) The proposed methodologies will go some way towards plugging information gaps emerging in a resource-light news environment and help defray the affects of ‘churnalism’ in a 24-hour news culture.

It is part of a broader research programme exploring different understandings of multimodality (e.g. Kress and Van Leeuwen 2001, Gibbons 2012) and developing evidence-based understanding of the skills involved in becoming a multimodal writer. It addresses the following specific research questions:

- Is it possible, in moving between different disciplines, data-driven material and autobiographical information, to explore one subject with genuine interdisciplinarity?

- Can such interdisciplinarity be realised by the conception and application of a consistent personal writing voice that fuses the range of material into one entity?

- Can this voice be used to bring a selection of ideas and information normally associated with academia to wider audiences?

Methods used were:

- Literature reviews of: friendship in fiction, political and moral philosophy; interdisciplinary creative non-fiction addressing broad subjects.

- Qualitative research: interviews; case studies, including of the author’s own practice; evidence-based consideration of the impact of Web 2.0 technology on friendship.

- Practitioner research: reflective diary assessing and developing ‘expert-intuition’ (Melrose 2006) and informing writing decisions.

The project follows Zeldin (1995) in moving among a range of disciplines, Epstein (2006) in developing a strong personal voice making an original contribution within one text on the subject of friendship, and Patrick White in taking an outsider perspective to shed new light on the human condition. The project has informed the work of other researchers and writers including Michèle Roberts (2012) and Alison Winch (2013). The project conceives of a multimodal writer as one who produces a body of work that comprises different genres (e.g. fiction and non-fiction) and is disseminated through a range of media (here radio, print journalism and book publishing), thus developing Harvey’s (2013) notion of a transmedia storyteller.

10004351,36,,1705862,T,Poems at Work: Grouping of Poems in Diverse Publications,Print and online journals,Portfolio of poetry published in diverse locations,,,,,,,,,,2013,,,False,,False,False,,,,,29,False,"This portfolio contains a group of 45 poems written over a period of six years, published individually by international journals and publishers. 

Each poem in this portfolio was written to answer its own specific research question, exemplified by the abstracts required and published in the Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAA). As a group, the poems attempt to establish a style which draws on the author’s previous writing experience as a journalist and film maker by marrying the clarity, concision, precision and accessibility of journalistic writing with the vivid visual, aural and narrative qualities of film, and the distillation, musicality and imagery of poetry. The poems seek to establish this clear journalistic/filmic artistic signature across a range of poetic forms and themes. They weave contemporary, colloquial language, active verbs, cadences of speech, clarity of expression and inventive use of imagery within free verse, formal structures and a long narrative poem, aiming to resonate with audiences more familiar with journalism and film.

These poems resume the author’s previous thematic concerns including human rights, individual freedom and employment, through an extended range of forms, including a research-based historical long narrative poem. 
Most of the poems are located in a combination of the mainstream modern lyric poetry tradition from Edward Thomas and Frost, and the confessional mode of Plath and Olds. However, the development of a deliberately journalistic/filmic voice and narrative potentially offers these poems appeal to new audiences, more familiar with the conventions and grammar of mass media. 

In focussing on publishers associated with particular professions and internet journals, the author aims to reach wider audiences, who might particularly respond to poems about contemporary concerns couched in the comforting rhythms of familiar metrical forms in combination with the visual imagery and direct speech of the author’s journalistic/filmic style.

10004351,36,,1705863,A,Ally Pally Prison Camp,,Oversteps Books,,,,,,978-1906856212,,,,2011,http://www.overstepsbooks.com/cat/ally-pally-prison-camp/,,False,,False,False,,,,,29,False,"This project draws on three different research practices (journalism, documentary film making and poetry) to produce an exploration of the experience of civilian internees during the First World War in a collage of paintings, photographs, extracts from letters and memoirs, historical endnotes and poems by the author. It resulted in a book, first presented at as a site-specific open public event at Alexandra Palace.

It asks: What happens to ordinary people when they are imprisoned without trial for an extended period? Is the structure of TV documentary effective when transformed into book form? How can poetry form an affective part of a book which uses a range of media to tell a historical story, investing personal fragments with new meaning and potentially bringing poetry to wider audiences? 

The book challenges and confronts a difficult history. It uses a narrative form developed from research into publicly accessible archives, personal collections, tracing of private correspondence and contact with family members of prisoners. It is edited and structured using the methodology of television documentary production to extract poignant and memorable ‘sound bites’ and images that help to tell the chronological story of an iconic London landmark. The juxtaposition of ‘found text’ and images is designed to lend immediacy, emotional depth and weight to the variety of experience of the prisoners, from humour to despair, and the themes of camaraderie, frustration, loss, and longing.

The book builds on themes of human rights and individual freedom in the author’s TV documentaries and previous poetry collections. The poems blend the narrative and lyric tradition of Hardy, Edward Thomas and Frost, the confessional form of Olds, and the direct voice of Hugo Williams to create a fictionalised interior voice for the silenced male prisoners.

10004351,36,,1705864,A,petite,,Hearing Eye,,,,,,978-1905082568,,,,2010,http://www.maggiebutt.co.uk/petite/,,False,,False,False,,,,,29,False,"This collection is a book-length sequence of poems of less than 20 lines each, exploring the range and depth of concise lyric verse to site the deeply ‘personal’ against ‘imagined’ experience, exploring the commonality of understanding across different lives.

Research questions focus on the short poem form: Is this distilled form robust enough to examine a wide range of contemporary subject matter? Is the impact of each poem enhanced or reduced by its placing in a sequence? What narrative virtues does it share with the photograph rather than the film?  Can the process of refinement and crystallisation open out questioning and insight?

The work uses concrete poetry, sonnet and free verse to encapsulate the experience of a life, including exploration of the loss of a parent and the growth of children, distilled into a particular thought or impression. The poems focus on a strong central image to produce a vivid mental picture for the reader. 

This book continues its author’s exploration of the short lyric as a form particularly suited to the pace of the modern world, and her previous work as a journalist and filmmaker in researching, visualising and sequencing the poems. It takes inspiration from the power of sonnet sequences, haiku collections and the short poetry anthology to experiment with the collective possibilities of short verse. 

The poems draw on the short-form traditions of Emily Dickinson, the Imagist poets and haiku (particularly Basho) combined with the confessional mode of Plath and Olds. They develop these into a pithy, epigrammatic mode which combines formal and free verse, honed and crafted for clarity of expression, immediacy and accessibility. They aim particularly to engage non-poetry audiences embedded in a culture of sound bites, tweets and text messages. Poems from the book have also been developed into a choreographed dance piece.

West's World seeks to explore how a famed literary figure presented herself publicly while suffering a great deal of personal tragedy and thus considers the relationship between the public and private for women in this era. It is the first book to consider how intimate details of West’s difficult personal relationships impacted on her work with a view to enhancing the reader’s empathy. It seeks to correct errors in other biographies. For example, the research for Glendinning¹s biography of West did not include interviewing Merlin Holland, a central figure (similar to an adopted son) in West’s later years, whom Glendinning mistakenly assumed had an older brother.
 
West’s World thus addresses the following question:
 
How can the traditional biographical arc, with its birth-to-life narrative, supplement an empathetic life writing account to renew interest in West’s own writing?
 
Research methods involved a mixture of archival research in the US, London, Amsterdam and former Yugoslavia, interviews with surviving friends and family, and textual analysis of contemporary letters with accounts of incidents. Whenever possible an oral account was used to further corroborate or contradict.
 
This book has affinities with, but also differs from, Gibb’s earlier biography, Lady Hester (2005), which was a more detached and adventurous story that took a more experimental approach to narrative structure. Taken together, these books creatively explore the gains and losses of popular, as opposed to experimental, forms of life writing, drawing on critical debates about normative conventions (Berlant 2011), modernist innovation (Marcus 1994) and public /private relations (Steedman 1992). Insights from this work also inform Gibb’s autobiographical writing, including her memoir Two Gardens (2013).

It involved the co-production of sixty-two professionally produced digital outputs for the gallery (including films, digital stories, photo essays and audio tracks), the design of c.350m2 of physical gallery space, the development of four interactive platforms (a touchscreen interface for showing films and digital stories, a sound bench and a multi-user touchtable map). The project also involved staging a Flickr competition to garner user-generated photographs for incorporation in a permanent slideshow in the gallery.  The research informed the gallery interpretation materials (text panels, labels etc.). ",,A,,,False,"This output consists of a £1.1million public display in The Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, contextualized in the portfolio by papers on the academic rationale and the exhibition process. The output constitutes an essential reference point for practitioners and academics concerned with: 1) exploring relationships between art, place and identity in museum settings; 2) community co-production of exhibitions; and 3) collaborative working between university and museums. Funded by the AHRC, We worked with sixty-seven members of the public from communities across Tyneside (including groups such as refugees and teenagers at risk of exclusion) as well as twenty-two high-profile artworld figures (e.g. Antony Gormley and Sir Nicolas Serota) and the Flickr community to develop new audio-visual material for the display. The display juxtaposes historical artworks connected to Tyneside with people’s personal testimonies about their experiences of living in the region and their visual (and for blind participants, non-visual) sense of place. These testimonies were co-produced with participants, who worked with us and with filmmakers, sound recordists, photographers and digital story makers, providing content for digital interactives which we designed. The interactives stand alongside artworks with the aims of: 1) constructively disturbing the cultural primacy of fine art as a form of expression; and 2) posing equivalences between past and present representations of and meditations on Tyneside; and 3) providing alternative and polyvocal interpretation which would provide access for visitors with a range of cultural capital. The project was underpinned by theoretical frameworks relating to new museology, aesthetics and place identity and by rigorous methods of sampling and giving voice to different communities. The significance and originality of the project lie in the attempt to bring art, place and community identities together and in incorporating people’s testimonies in digital form within a gallery context, thus refashioning the epistemological frame of the art museum.

The research aims of this practice-based output were: 1) to investigate the limits and possibilities of the often-didactic ‘campaign documentary’ form; and 2) to develop documentary practice as an innovative form of Media and Cultural Studies research praxis situated within political action. The first aim was pursued through an audio-visual strategy intended to reveal a politics of ‘affect’ and to construct an ambiguous and emotionally resonant documentary, for example by interlacing naïve protesters struggling to make an impact with the heartfelt memories of those close to Fashanu of him as footballer, uncle, lover or friend. Contrary to the conventions of mainstream documentaries, the effectiveness of the protesters and the veracity of the testimonies are secondary to emotional impact. The second research aim was carried out through developing a critically-reflexive form of activism.  Justin the film in effect ‘produced’ the Justin Campaign (not vice-versa): the campaign emerged from the search for a narrative framework for Fashanu’s suicide. The film is not just a representation of a campaign but is a constitutive part of a politics of affect central to the campaign, and an intervention into the cultural politics of sport that seeks to simultaneously provoke discussion of homophobia while contributing to social change. Screened at many international film festivals (including Frameline in San Francisco, USA), campaign meetings (including Birmingham LGBT Pride in Sports) and academic conferences (including the American Sociological Association), Justin has raised the profile of the campaign. It has informed challenges to the stereotyping and stigmatisation of gay athletes, e.g. the official support given by the Football Association to the annual week of action against homophobia in football, a Justin Campaign initiative."
10007799,36,,3253607,Q,Melancholic Constellations: The Art of William Kentridge,,Interventions,,,,,,,,,,2010,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNzISG0ere8,0,False,,False,False,,,B,,,False,"Melancholic Constellations (2010) explores the art of William Kentridge in context. Previous documentaries about Kentridge adhere to the ‘masterclass’ formula and provide little critical insight into the personal and political forces that shape Kentridge’s art within the context of Apartheid and ‘post Anti-Apartheid’ South Africa. The research aim of this fifty-five minute film was to explore the possibility of developing an ‘expressive documentary’. This involves a documentary address that is not illustrative or didactic, but embraces and reflects ambiguities and ambivalences present in all social interactions. Methodologically it places a responsibility on the audience to create and interpret meaning from the edited sequences. The decision to discard the educational and informational imperative of much documentary practice is evident in the ambiguous and suggestive imaging of Kentridge’s art. For example, a sequence where passers-by on the street stand to gaze at Kentridge’s art which is being back-projected from the University of Brighton gallery can be interpreted as representing people’s exclusion from elitist art, or their admiration for the internationally successful artist. The scene is a provocation about art production and artist-audience relationships. Comparable ambiguity characterises interviews with Johannesburg artists and scholars, edited to pose a series of provocations rather than set positions about the politics of art-making in contemporary South Africa. The film was part of a larger project including an exhibition of Kentridge’s work in Brighton funded through a peer-reviewed £80,000 Arts Council award.  Footage was extended and re-edited for use in gallery space. The film premiered in Brighton at the Cine-City Film Festival. The Centre for the Study of Contemporary Art at UCL hosted a screening as part of a symposium on the politics of Art in South Africa. It was screened and discussed as part of the Johannesburg Workshop in Theory and Criticism at the University of Witwatersrand."
10007799,36,,3253608,Q,Willem Boshoff: Reflections of a South African Artist,,Interventions,,,,,,,,,,2010,https://vimeo.com/72657134,0,False,,False,True,,,B,,,False,"The research aims of this experimental documentary were 1) to provide a personal portrait of one of South Africa’s most enduring artists; 2) to illuminate a neglected story of opposition and resistance from Afrikaans-speaking South Africans to Apartheid; and 3) to create a hybrid form combining political and biographical documentary and filmic portrait, opening new critical and aesthetic perspectives. Shot during his residency at the Cradle of Humankind near Johannesburg and interspersed with visuals of a retrospective at Johannesburg Art Gallery, Willem Boshoff muses upon a life ‘at odds’ with himself, with his ‘own people’, and with Apartheid.  The film was made as part of a larger, peer-reviewed project funded through an £80,000 Arts Council grant that included a film and an exhibition of the art of fellow South African, William Kentridge. Willem Boshoff is influenced by and significantly extends the use of interviews as portraiture by US filmmaker Errol Morris.  As the colour in the images drain away to become pure black and white, heightening the deep lines on Boshoff’s face, and as the ever-moving Boshoff fills the frame in varying degrees of magnification, the journalistic and documentary convention of the ‘talking head’ is simultaneously subverted and transformed into portraiture. Willem Boshoff transforms the traditional interview format into a politico-aesthetic experience, challenging journalistic and documentary tropes. By bringing the aesthetics of portraiture normally into the cinematic documentary space it constitutes a momentary reversal of the trend to bring documentaries into the gallery space.  The film was screened and discussed with Willem Boshoff as the key respondent at a seminar hosted by the Faculty of Arts at the University of Brighton. The film has also been screened and discussed at symposia in the UK and South Africa."
10007799,36,,3253610,Q,Algorithms,,AkamPuram,,,,,,,,,,2012,http://www.algorithmsthedocumentary.com/,0,False,,True,False,"Algorithms is an international feature documentary that required detailed planning, the skilful management of multiple relationships, and the execution of creative and technical skills.  The three-year shoot generated a considerable body of original material (260 hours of footage) on a community to which access is not easily gained. The lengthy period of shooting and immersion in the blind chess community, followed by sixteen months of editing, produced a multi-layered feature documentary that has made possible the presentation of critical insights into a marginalised community, as well as critical reflections of mainstream ‘ocular-centric’ society.",,B,,,False,"Algorithms is a feature documentary focusing on blind and visually-impaired youths and their blind mentor and coach in India. The research aims of this practice-based output were: 1) to develop ethnographic film practice capable of representing its unusual protagonists sensitively, without sensationalising them or perpetuating otherness; and 2) to create a new ‘creative-critical’ filmic narrative combining fine art expressive possibilities with audio-visual techniques from documentary practice. For example, the expressive rather than illustrative aesthetic places responsibility to construct and interpret meaning on the audience, rather than relying on narration (i.e. voice-over or expert-interviews). This is supported by cinematographic techniques: hand-held camera movements, long takes, extreme close-ups (of faces and fingers) and high-contrast black-and-white images. Intended for big-screen theatre viewing, these techniques combine with intense exchanges between the protagonists to create an immersive audience experience, countering the detached ‘looking on’ typical of documentary. Algorithms is the first feature documentary on blind chess and its significance for blind and visually impaired people, especially in India. Through ethnographic immersion in the lifeworld of the blind chess community, Algorithms reveals affinities between the experience of blindness and the tactile and cognitive game of chess. Following the reflexive tradition of Direct Cinema filmmakers (e.g. Jean Rouch), the danger of Orientalism inherent in the relationship between Western able-bodied filmmaker and disabled Indian Other is consciously undermined. The visual anthropological exploration of blindness as a form of alterity becomes a cultural critique of ‘ocular-centric’ society, subverted in the by-line of the film: “four moves in, we are all blind”.

The original footage on which the documentary is based, by Beatrice Blackwood in Papua New Guinea (1936–7) and Ursula Graham Bower in Manipur, India (1939), is also available on this website.

Captured by Women was produced by the anthropologist and filmmaker Alison Kahn at The Oxford Academy of Documentary Film, in collaboration with the Pitt Rivers Museum, and with the help of a grant from UK Film Council via Screen South. As part of the project, Alison Kahn interviewed experts and relations of the filmmakers, and the film narrates the lives of the women as well as investigating their motivations in making these films.

The film uses the notion of magical transformation as a part of cultural translation through film to lead the viewer from the Pitt Rivers Museum’s displays and the objects collected by both women, to their photographs, and finally the original film footage. This one-hour documentary has been filmed on HD for a cinematic release and incorporates the pixilation method of rapid D-SLR photography that animates the objects discussed. The experience of watching the original 16mm film with the sound of projection, that would have been the only aural accompaniment to the silent film footage, is combined with the presentation of scenes and sound effects made with current digital technology."

This chapter proposes a theoretical approach to the study of genres in contemporary Italian cinema. I apply a specific perspective derived from Rick Altman’s seminal pragmatic approach to the study of film genres as an alternative to more traditional models that tend to see genres as pre-coded texts in terms of themes, iconography and audience expectations. The pragmatic approach takes account of multiple factors including production and distribution systems; societal and cultural elements; and reception trends. This chapter demonstrates how a general awareness of  these factors among contemporary Italian filmmakers has accompanied a revival of genres in recent production output.",,,,False,

G. Sebald’s novel The Rings of Saturn. Patience was conceived as a work of audio-visual literary criticism in the form of a film-essay and my critical interest in the relationship between essayistic forms in literature and cinema was germane to the project.
In collaboration with director and producer I compiled a list of interviewees, formulating the themes we wished to address, particularly the central idea of ‘pilgrimage’ as a contemporary practice of engaging with space and place. I originated the practical idea of a ‘Patience deck’ (a stack of postcard-sized reproductions of images from Sebald’s book), which we gave interviewees during filming, asking them to select images. This eased them into the filming process and provided Gee with material bringing together spoken contributions and images. Several key sequences were subsequently constructed around contributions elicited thus. I worked on ten of the fourteen filmed interviews.
 I collaborated on both the rough and fine cuts prior to the world premiere in Aldeburgh, January 2011. In 2010, I did public presentations with Gee of work-in-progress sequences from the film where we addressed the challenges of bringing Sebald’s book to the screen: at ‘Landscaping: Artists, Maps and Britain’ at the British Library in September and ‘Cine-City: Brighton Film Festival’ in November. I also did a solo presentation at the ‘Film Criticism in Dialogue’ symposium at the University of Kent in November 2010. Following the UK theatrical release in January 2012, I undertook joint and solo public presentations throughout the UK."

In this project I set out to produce a series of films to be screened in the slum communities in which they were shot and to be used simultaneously in Amnesty International and Witness campaigns.
The series is a component of an avowedly activist practice-as-research in which both filming and screening in Port Harcourt’s slums are a means of investigating and increasing the capacity of these communities to mobilise. The practice develops an approach to filmmaking as political intervention predicated on an iterative and participatory process of production and projection. My films were screened to participants who became critical spectators of their own image and in turn actors and directors of future productions. Footage from these later phases was, in turn, screened back to them. The central research question at the heart of this process was how might these films inform the ways in which their subjects see themselves and imagine their futures?  The resources for self-representation embedded within the project, as well as the spaces of debate they create, develop the capacity of residents to wrest control of how their settlements are represented and how their city is planned.
In this connection the project deployed participatory media production to connect grassroots advocacy and planning efforts with international campaign networks and urban environment multilaterals, such as Amnesty International and UN-HABITAT. The collaborative process of production and the social spaces of exhibition, then, are at once objects and instruments of research: process and product together constitute these outputs. Film work and how film is put to work, the social labour of film production and the social event of its exhibition are central to the research. "

It was co-curated by Witt, Professor Nicole Brenez (Université Paris 3 – Sorbonne Nouvelle), and Dr Michael Temple (Birkbeck), in association with Stuart Comer (Curator of Film, Tate Modern) and Laurent Mannoni and Pierre d’Amerval of the Cinémathèque française, Paris.

The overwhelming majority of written accounts of French avant-garde cinema rehearse the same periods, movements and filmmakers (Dada/Surrealism; the narrative avant-garde of the 1920s; the 1960s), misrepresenting the tradition as one of purely formal experimentation. Against this backdrop, the season set out to achieve the following research objectives: to construct a fresh history of the field through the pursuit of curation as a research practice; to demonstrate the diversity and vitality of this tradition by showcasing works from every decade; to make available numerous films that had never been shown in the UK (this was the case for over 80% of the 90 films screened); and to demonstrate the inseparability in the French context of an engagement by avant-garde filmmakers with political struggles and everyday experiences and an interrogation of the conventions and constrictions of mainstream cinema.

Witt’s work on the season included archival research; selecting prints at the Cinémathèque française; co-designing with Brenez and Temple the season’s fifteen-programme architecture; and setting out the research agenda behind the season in the introductory text (2,200 words) and the presentation of the fifteen programmes (4,600 words) that he co-authored with them for the 24-page booklet published by Tate Modern.

The event was extremely well attended, and audience feedback and press coverage (Financial Times, 17 March 2008; Libération, 13 March 2008) indicated that its central aim of reconfiguring the field through curation was successfully achieved."

I was a founding member of the company, with the film’s director and co-director.
A key aspect of the collaboration was researching the historical and methodological implications of reenactment in documentary and the exchange between the methods of fiction and documentary production that came to deeply define The Act of Killing. My contribution to the film included taking a central role in conducting research, which resulted in numerous authored and co-authored papers (including chapters in such publications as Killer Images (Ten Brink ed. Wallflower/Columbia Press 2012), Fluid Screens/Expanded Cinema (Marchessault and Lord eds. University of Toronto Press, 2007) and Building Bridges (Ten Brink ed. Wallflower 2007).   I translated these research findings into a conceptual framework and innovative approach to filmmaking that significantly informed our production. This approach, which I term in my own research ‘archaeological performance’, is a performance-based historiography of political violence that draws extensively on historical reenactment and genre re-stagings.  Thus the production process is a research process, and the film is both research method and object.
Throughout the first six years of production I was intensely engaged with the film’s director and co-director as a creative consultant; an essential feature of our collaboration. This involved planning shoots, reviewing and feeding back on hundreds of hours of footage, working on and responding to edits, as well as engaging in the sustained debates around documentary ethics that attended the film’s production. This work also generated an archive of primary material that is of itself of value to researchers – it is the largest collection of AV materials on genocide in N Sumatra."
10007776,36,,2007258,Q,Escravos,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"On the western fringes of the Niger Delta, the Escravos estuary opens onto the Atlantic: the site of a multi-billion dollar Gas-to-Liquid project, hundreds of well-heads and gas flares, and a region in which armed militancy, state security, international oil corporations and organised crime networks are as intertwined as the tangle of pipelines. In May 2009, Nigerian government forces attacked communities in the region with helicopter gunships and gunboats. Ostensibly an offensive aimed at up-rooting militant networks, one village was razed. 
ESCRAVOS comprises fragments of what I describe in other scholarly contexts as a ‘narrative geography’ of the western Delta. This approach is predicated on the notion that the political economy of the delta is graphically inscribed in its geography: ‘hidden in the order of space is a social order’ (Henri Lefebvre). The film sets out to frame the relationships that structure this space: the mud huts in the shadow of multi-billion dollar facilities, or found-frames the camera searches out and settles on, a blown out window in the last standing wall of a house, a doorway planted in the rubble. These critically composed images are an analysis of the delta’s economy of extraction and spectacular violence.
This collection of video studies and testimonies focuses on Joshua – a young builder; perhaps witness to a massacre – and his return to Okerenkoko after the incursion. In this sense, the series is not only research into film form as ‘narrative-geography’, but also an archive of primary materials on a significant episode of state-sponsored violence.
ESCRAVOS was conceived as a projection and performance piece originally staged at the Museum of London, the Dutch Art Institute and the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. It was projected with live voiceover translation and commentary. It has been subtitled for submission and intertitles have been added."

It asks what insights this process offers on the current transformation of British society?  What new ideas of social inclusion and sustainable development are articulated and literally built into the fabric of the city by architecture, urban design and planning practice? What does belonging mean to the inhabitants of a modern city? And to whom does the city belong?
These questions are explored via engagement with the filmmaking process as a critical and creative mode of research - a practice that “overlaps with issues around knowledge production associated with the social sciences” (Wayne, 2008) - and with documentary as form. This practice is particularly well-equipped to decipher and render the complex process of shaping the physical and social urban Space in Time, and has the potential to deliver novel insights and lived and embodied knowledge  unique to this research method.
The film’s interrogative journey moves between two polarities – on one hand, the city and the forces at play in its transformation; on the other, the self, the individual, the citizen, the local filmmaker. It negotiates its own personal space, identity and belonging within this context. The multi-perspective architecture of its narrative structure takes issue with the ‘unique truth’ and the ‘objectivity’ of the ‘subject researcher’, experimenting with modes of narration capable of reflecting this multilayered reality. The participatory observational approach is also interrogated and challenged via this process and dialogues with other modes of representation, such as first-person narrative and archival footage.
Co-produced by Serge Lalou, Les film d'ici (France) and Sandra Whipham (UK) for ARTE France, Home Sweet Home premiered at Opencity Docs Fest (shortlisted for Time Out Best City Film award) and was shown at various film festivals, including Turin."

Its conceptual architecture aims to provide a generative framework for developing new perspectives on urban experience. 
Drawing on archaeologist/artist Michael Shanks’ notion of “deep-mapping” and Jesse Shapins’ theory and practices around urban representation, the i-doc combines the extensive video archives created for my documentary film “Home Sweet Home” (over 200 hours), with other relevant data/archives, including content from the National Archives and the local Cuming Museum’s catalogue. It also includes open data about the area and user-generated content, to allow users to spatially explore the layers of memory, stories and media embedded within a single location. 
Engaging with one of modernity's ruins, the Heygate Estate in London,  the project proposes an immersive, interactive and participatory journey of discovery that brings in the participants at the heart of the process of urban and social transformation . It  provides an opportunity for users to critically engage with its traces, to develop into active citizens capable of connecting, understanding and engaging with the complex modern urban space we inhabit, and ultimately empowering them to promote change and play an active role in society. 
The i-doc engages with key questions about new forms of documentary storytelling and the shifting nature of authorial agency. In particular it focuses on three key points in digital storytelling: interactivity in narratives, multiple points-of-view, and the design of interfaces which function as narrative devices to communicate stories. Exploring the relationship between Narrative and Computational Structure, it experiments with different ways in which an interactive interface can deepen the narrative experience of, and customize the journey through, a story space. This initial chapter sets up the concept of story space and introduces the users to the idea of a story as navigated journey."

It premiered at the BFI International London Film Festival in 2012 and was broadcast on BBC4 Storyville in 2013. It also received theatrical distribution and DVD release through Verve Pictures. The project was conceived, filmed and directed by Marc Isaacs. 

The film looks at the lives of various immigrants, from different generations and ethnic backgrounds, living along the A5 (a road stretching from London to the Welsh coast) and sets out to investigate, and shed light upon, the meaning of migration, place and identity for them. In so doing, the documentary examines some of the hidden aspects, and complexities, of ‘multicultural’ Britain by revealing the individual stories underpinning migration (whether forced or voluntary) and exploring the personal and psychological consequences of displacement, and a sense of ‘in-betweenness’, for those involved. 

In order to engage with the experiential dimensions of migration, the film also departs from traditional forms of television journalism and observational documentary in favour of more experimental - ‘participant observation’ - methods of documentary filming. This approach involved Isaacs developing relationships of trust and intimacy with the people in the film prior to shooting and then interacting with them during the actual making of the film. In this way, he was not only able to gain access to places that would normally remain hidden from view but also to uncover feelings and emotions that would otherwise be difficult to ‘document’. In this respect, his work involves the testing of new methods of documentary in order to generate new insights regarding the specific experiences of the migrant (as well as more general themes of belonging and isolation).

The film grew out of Clayton’s work teaching video to young asylum-seekers in the UK (initially in association with Project Phakama and subsequently with the Children’s Society and Tavistock Clinic). Such children struggle to prove their refugee status and at 18 can be summarily deported from the UK. The UK Border Agency does not track these deportees but has historically claimed that they are safe. Clayton’s research involved an investigation into such claims through the long-term gathering of documentary evidence of what actually occurs in such a situation. With the help of local borough care teams, solicitors and refugee networks, she established contact with - and filmed - a number of unaccompanied teenagers awaiting asylum decisions and then documented the experiences of one particular deportee. This involved secretly filming Hamedullah’s deportation and providing him with a small camera that he was able to take back to Afghanistan where he, and later a new friend, shot material that was smuggled back to the UK on DVD. This material was then included in Clayton’s final film. In this regard, the film has not only involved an experimental approach to documentary filming, involving building trust and a collaborative relationship with a young (and frightened) deportee, but has also provided unique visual evidence of the effects of the UK government’s deportation policy. Partly for security reasons, and partly due to Clayton’s interest in ‘mythic’ story-telling structures, the film does, however, omit some of the ‘facts’ of Hamedullah’s specific case. This means that the film may be seen not only to document an individual’s actual experience but also to symbolise the position of deported young people more generally. "

The plays rely heavily upon primary archival research - including the transcripts of German POWs recorded by refugees working for the British Secret Service (in the National Archives), the transcripts of German Nuclear Scientists bugged by the British at Farm Hall as they heard of the Hiroshima bomb (in the Library of Congress) and minutes of meetings between the Head of the Jewish Community and the Gestapo (in the StadtArchiv in Mainz) - as well as interviews with those involved in the creation and release of material (including Ganz’s own father, Peter Ganz, Fritz Lustig, Professor Soenke Neitzel then of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz and Sir Michael Atiyah, FRS OM). The plays themselves combine historical record with personal narratives which, through the use of different artistic strategies, explore the complex processes of remembering and forgetting involved in the survival of trauma and passing on of cultural memory to the next generation. In this respect, Ganz’s work also involves an investigation into the possibilities and limitations of adapting and dramatising historical transcripts, and exploring different kinds of creative response to the gaps and silences that the historical record leaves (including the use of diegetic and non-diegetic music, unreliable narration, and the employment of radio journalist Robin Lustig to give voice to the archive).  Ganz has reflected upon aspects of this process in a paper for the Adaptation Studies Conference in Berlin (2010) and for History Workshop Online (‘On Speaking and Silence and the Refusal of Historical Accuracy’, http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/on-speaking-and-silence-and-the-refusal-of-historical-accuracy/).

",,BBC Radio 4 documentary,,,,,,,,,,2009,http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ktgkl ,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This 30-minute radio documentary was commissioned by the BBC for Radio 4 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the American folk singer, songwriter, actor and media figure’s birth. Originally broadcast on 11 June 2009, the documentary has since been repeated on BBC World Service to further wide and international listening audiences. 
In the programme Lee continues his exploration of popular media culture evident across his body of BBC radio documentaries. Lee’s is innovative media practice research that draws on archive sound material and original recorded interviews, insights from his published academic research, a certain performative presence and interest as a media and music ‘personality’, and also makes use of the sonic possibilities of radio as a media form. 
The documentary contains an analytical tracking of Ives's rise to fame from impoverished hobo to hosting radio shows with Bing Crosby and acting in Hollywood in the 1940s, through his support for Communist causes, subsequent blacklisting by the House Un-American Activities Committee and his desperate response of informing against his fellow folk musicians, notably Pete Seeger, in order to continue his career. 
By using archive recordings and conducting interviews with American folk singer Julie Felix, Lee’s programme builds a soundscape that illustrates both the influence of the career of one man, who is perhaps best remembered today for his songs for children, and the turbulent periods in American history that moulded him. 
Contemporary to the broadcast, Lee gave a keynote address at the University of Minnesota on the American Influence on the British Folk Revival of the 1950s, and the subject of politics and music is explored in his chapter ‘Like The Night: reception and reaction Dylan UK 1966’ in C.J. Sheehy and T. Swiss eds. Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan’s Road from Minnesota to the World (University of Minnesota Press, 2009).

The programme was first aired on 9 November 2009; it has been repeated several times, and extracts from the original interviews used extensively in subsequent radio popular music documentaries, most recently in October 2013 on BBC Radio 2’s Didn't It Rain: When The Blues Came To Britain.  
In the programme Lee continues his exploration of popular media culture evident across his body of BBC radio documentaries. Lee’s is innovative media practice research that draws on archive sound material and original recorded interviews, insights from his published academic research, a certain performative presence and interest as a media and music ‘personality’, and also makes use of the sonic possibilities of radio as a media form. 

Lee’s oral history technique blends a montage of interviews with participants who were at the original television recording, including fans, the producer Johnnie Hamp, and the tour manager. He also paints an aural landscape around the featured performances of some of the leading artists, including Muddy Waters and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. With his insight into the import of the event and analysis of why it became one of the most influential music television programmes of the 1960s, Lee also includes commentators such as British blues singer and presenter Paul Jones and American academic Gayle Wald to discuss the show’s post-concert legacy in relation to transatlantic popular music. 
Lee’s published work in the field includes his 2002 book Shake Rattle and Rain: Popular Music-Making in Manchester 1995-1995. He incorporated many of the musical elements of the show in an invited concert at the Lowry Theatre, Manchester with John Cooper-Clarke on 1 August 2009.

Goffman continued to enjoy Warner’s support through to the completion of his 1953 PhD, in which his concept of the ‘interaction order’ was introduced. From 1949 onwards, however, Goffman’s engagement with Warner waned as his own sociological vision crystallized.

Produced through the production company One Day Films Ltd, the film is part of Knudsen’s ongoing critical and practical exploration of ideas through the media practice of filmmaking.

The work is an exploration of transcendental narrative strategies that can enhance our engagement with themes that go beyond psychology. How can one create narratives that engage with our participatory feelings rather than our self assertive emotions? This work challenges the hegemonic dominance of (variations of) the classical narrative within independent film. Developing story and narrative theories of Arthur Koestler, Paul Schrader, Patrick Hogan and Christopher Booker, Knudsen has examined existing practices within narrative film in such works as ‘Zen and the art of film narrative: towards a transcendental realism in film’ (Journal of Screenwriting, 1(2): 2010, 343-355), and constructed a rigorous link between theory and practice in developing the film. An original narrative approach challenges the function of dialogue, psychological motivation, story perspectives and the role of protagonists. The result is a narrative work whose silently-portrayed elliptical stories told from a uniquely non-human narrative perspective contribute significant new possibilities for telling cinematic stories in narrative film.

Premiered as one of only 15 international feature films in the official section of the Anchorage International Film Festival, USA, in December 2010, the premiere was accompanied by a keynote speech by Knudsen which articulated the research outcomes in the context of the digital revolution in film production and distribution and explored what its potential impact may be on film policy and production practices. 

The film is available to the general international public on DVD and as online streaming/downloads through a variety of vendors such as Amazon.com and Onedayfilms.com.

Produced through the production company One Day Films Ltd, the film is part of Knudsen’s ongoing critical and practical exploration of ideas through the media practice of filmmaking.

The work is an exploration of transcendental narrative strategies that can enhance our engagement with themes that go beyond the psychology of material observation. How can the narrative form of documentary be evolved to engage us subjectively and participatorally in actuality that goes beyond the material? This work challenges the hegemonic dominance of documentary as journalistically-driven sociological or anthropological observations of human materialistic conditions. Developing story and narrative theories from Arthur Koestler, Paul Schrader and Alan Rosenthal, as well as the documentary innovations of Sergei Dvortsevoy, Knudsen has examined existing practices within documentary film in such works as ‘Transcendental realism in documentary’ (in W. de Jong and T.R. Austin, eds., 2008. Rethinking the Documentary, Open University Press,108-120), and constructed a rigorous link between theory and practice in developing the film. An original narrative approach challenges the role of the spoken word and transcends the need for psychological motivation of character and narrative. By employing a meditative observational aesthetic, as well as a cyclical narrative structure, viewers are invited to engage spiritually with a subject without the usual recourse to objective knowledge or back stories.

Premiered at the Zinebi - International Documentary and Short Film Festival, Bilbao, Spain, in November 2009, the film has subsequently been part of a number of international presentations, including University of Colombia, UTAR Malaysia, EICTV, Cuba. The film is available to the general international public on DVD and as online streaming/downloads through a variety of outlets such as Vimeo.com and Onedayfilms.com.

The research was mainly conducted by two separate methods of analysis. The significance of the research is that it argues that cultural representations presented as news within the South Wales Argus are effectively ‘survival strategies’ that are produced to maintain a monopolistic market position in Gwent and that cultural representations are also the ideological product of the paper’s perceptions of a Gwent community. The paper explains how cultural representations are market strategies and that cultural representation is also a product of myth in the sense that Roland Barthes forwarded. It outlines the history of Gwent – changing its name to Monmouthshire in the 16th century and back to Gwent in 1974 – and outlines how the Argus plays upon cultural memory in a Welsh-historical context by actively pursuing and producing an ‘imagined geography’ as detailed in Edward Said’s 1998 work in Orientalism. This is based on the paper’s perception of the ‘Gwent’ community in spite of the fact that ‘Gwent’ as an actual geographical area today does not exist in any real form, and is equally an attempt to persuade the audience of a Gwent reality via cultural production. News Discourse Analysis of data and application of theoretical frameworks found that the language used and the way news was framed by the Argus was evidence of a manufactured construct based on myth.

Within this framework the book assessed the philosophical and cultural context on which journalism is based and researched the relationship between ‘individualism’ (Liberal Philosophy) and ‘communitarianism’ that prioritises the ‘collective community’. This led to a central research question, namely what is the social purpose of journalism? To explore the question effectively chapter one ‘History and Context: News and Newspapers’ reflects on the cultural history of journalism. Chapter two ‘Journalism’ then explores the ‘social purpose’ and ‘meaning’ of journalism and offers a definition in relation to a discourse on ethics. Chapter three assesses the influence of liberalism for framing the philosophical context of news and journalism and focuses on the Liberal notion of ‘individualism’ and assessed how this impacts on the ethics of news. Chapter four places the previous discussion in the context of media ethics and responsibilities and assessed ‘communitarianism’ – as opposed to Liberalism – by introducing a discussion on the US based Public Journalism idea. The final chapter explores the two concepts that are pivotal to journalism ethics, namely ‘truth’ and ‘objectivity’. The book calls for audience research normally associated with media and cultural studies and absent in media ethics, to more clearly assess the cultural effects of news on society within an ethical framework.

The book is currently being translated into Arabic by the King Saud Translation Centre, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia.

10006022,36,,499633,B,"Revisiting the Frankfurt School: Essays on Culture, Media and Theory",,Ashgate,,,,,,9781409411802,,,,2012,,,False,,False,False,,,C,,,False,"This book was developed because of the misleading representation of what is often referred to as the ‘Frankfurt School’ and therefore is a direct response to suspect research conducted mainly in British Media and Cultural Studies. Its rationale was to reassess the work of the ‘Frankfurt School’ who have been reduced to a small number of thinkers and provides a broader understanding of the works of writers who were closely aligned, loosely associated or on the margins of the institution known as the Frankfurt School to gain a more detailed understanding of their collective work. So for instance I’ve introduced Siegfried Kracauer, Erich Fromm, Leo Lowenthal and Hans Magnus Enzensberger along with Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Jürgen Habermas; further to this Dallas Smythe is introduced by way of comparison to the works of Adorno. 

My chapter titled ‘Max Horkheimer: Issues concerning Liberalism and Culture’ attempts to show Max Horkheimer in a new light by discussing his insights on cultural development and social justice in relation to liberalism (and neo-liberalism) and culture. Overall Horkheimer wrote less than his colleagues and was side-lined to a large extent on discussions concerning culture and society with others in the field more prominent. However, this chapter attempts to correct that deficit because Horkheimer produced some interesting intellectual insights into the meaning of culture, and I provide documents to show this, not least from the much neglected Eclipse of Reason. The chapter shows how Horkheimer blended ‘pessimism’ and ‘suffering’ from Schopenheaur and ‘materialism’ from Marx to offer his unique form of cultural analysis, set against liberalism and authoritarianism and explains that like Marcuse, critical opposition to capitalism wasn’t completely negated under an oppressive form of domination that attempts to reduce the meaning of ‘individualism’ to matters of consumption rather than critique.

10006022,36,,499674,B,Public Policy and Media Organisations,,Ashgate,,,,,,9781409402756,,,,2013,,1,False,,False,False,,,C,,,False,"The research for this publication involved re-examining the political philosophers in respect of what is termed the ‘common’ good’, ‘well-being’, ‘good-life’ and ‘happiness’ and how such theoretical contexts underpin thinking in public policy that is meant to bring benefits to society. The cultural memory (or history of ideas) of Western philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Marsilius of Padua, Thomas Aqiunas and many more) seep into contemporary narratives concerning the dissemination of public policy. The overall aim therefore was to assess the political and moral thinking behind government decision-making concerning public policy and further explore how news reports frame and represent public policy issues within a cultural context. In so doing the research explored how government and news media base thinking and representation on perceptions of community in the name of the ‘public interest’. 

Chapter one assesses the contribution of political philosophy, chapter two then assesses the ‘Big Society’ as public policy ideology and as a form of bureaucratic authority to shape society. Chapter three presents a discussion on news and the public interest and assesses a number of empirical examples of news representations of public policy issues. Chapter four to six are written by Dr Caroline Kamau, a Social Psychologist designed to assess key psychological processes between production and consumption of public policy

Control keywords orientate new users to the scope of the material held on the database, but users can also use their own search terms. In response to user searches, the FVDD produces a series of contingent histories based on hard evidence, whose documentary basis is immediately available to the user for further scrutiny. Across multiple searches, any individual compositional element will occupy different positions in the representational chain and its significance will shift accordingly. For historical study, this allows the polyvocalness of an event or record to be represented – showing its place in multiple causal lines – rather than being excluded at an earlier compositional stage. This makes it unique in the way it represents history and allows study of the multiple factors impacting on non-mainstream moving image distributors’ ability to operate effectively to ‘deliver’ a wider range of work to audiences. The database has been specifically designed to be expandable, and as more content is added to it from the 90gb offline archive, the FVDD will become an increasingly rich, useful and productive resource for users. In the past year, the database has been technically upgraded to allow remote multi-user inputting. This has enabled Knight to start recruiting a volunteer user group to help with uploading new content, but also (1) allows users to engage in research through the process of inputting, having self-selected material for uploading that is relevant to their own interests, and (2) develops long-term sustainability for the resource both in terms of content updating and the potential to pass on/share editorial oversight."

The auto-ethnographic design of the project also required substantial time for reflection and reiteration – necessary to achieve a resolution of the personal, familial and representational issues involved in its creation, given its intimate subject matter, its engagement with mourning, and its aim of binding individual life stories into broader historical trajectories.  ",,,,,False,"On the Border explores how memory and post-memory may be represented in auto/biographical film. It builds on the work of feminist visual artists eg Citron, Akerman and Spence to highlight the ways in which biography is a ‘dialogic making of the biographer and her subject’ (Radstone, 2006: 384).  
The film seeks to innovate within the biographical genre by eschewing a narrative of cause and effect in favour of a more associative form; for example, abrupt temporal dislocations between sequences are used to imply traces of the past in the present. The film foregrounds inter-subjective elements of biographical narration through the use of multiple voices where the speech shifts from first to third person and from speaker to speaker. Processes of identification and projection, usually only implicit in the genre, and particularly intense in a family context, are highlighted through this shifting point of view. Contrasting accounts/visions in different registers of Thynne’s grandfather’s death in action are counterpointed so as to evoke the subjective dimensions of traumatic historical events and their impact on memory and identity.
The concept of the border is used to invoke different levels of history, personal and public: the ways in which boundaries are both blurred and inscribed between family members, generations and siblings; the disputed and changing border between Finland and the USSR; the borderline between conscious and unconscious, ‘sanity’ and ‘madness’, ‘real’ and ‘imagined’. The film is published online with open access in Screenworks vol 4, 2013 where it is intended to be viewed alongside a 2000 word research statement.  To date presentations have been at international conferences including ‘Visible Evidence’ (Stockholm, 2013); FOHN (Helsinki, 2012); ‘Grievings’ (Ustron, Poland, 2012) as well as in public settings such as the Finnish Church in London (2013).  Thynne discusses the film in an interview for Re-frame  (2013).

10007806,36,,3356612,Q,Noise: a human history of sound and listening,,BBC Radio Series,,,,,,,,,,2013,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"As stated in its ‘Commissioning Guidelines’, the BBC required programmes in its ‘narrative history’ slot to display ‘creative and intellectual ambition’ and to demonstrate they would say ‘new things’ about their chosen subject. Noise accordingly aimed at a history of sound which, rather than focusing on acoustics, would place questions of culture, social relations, subjective experience and power at its centre, and to do so in the form of an original ‘grand narrative’, chronologically and geographically, by drawing on previously unconnected specialist studies in the fields of archaeology, architecture, ethnography, and social history. 

A wide range of secondary material, which cut across disciplines, was examined and synthesised, but primary sources were also used throughout. The series entailed extensive fieldwork, with claims about the acoustic properties of sites being tested: fifty-six locations in 10 countries were visited to explore the material evidence of past soundscapes. The research also involved identifying, locating, and then making novel use of recorded sound archives. The aim was to use ethnographic work not just as illustrative evidence of its own era, but to explore, through analogy, how sound might have been experienced in the deeper past. 

Rigour was ensured through a process of peer reviewing. Draft scripts being sent to for comments to relevant academic experts. Curators at the British Library Sound Archive and senior BBC editorial staff were also regularly consulted.

A broader intellectual context for each programme was provided through (a) links on the BBC website to related content, such as archives or specialist blogs written by curators, and (b) a book to accompany the series, which, though written with a broad, non-expert audience in mind, provided extra textual details in each chapter, a ‘Notes’ section referencing all sources, and an Introduction/Epilogue which stated more explicitly the series’ claims to originality and significance.

It was later shown as a solo exhibition curated by The Art House (UK) during the Long Division arts and music festival in 2013. The NYC exhibition catalogue and a published review are included as part of this submission alongside materials from the British exhibition.
 
This project explores the narrative potential of digital media through the construction of an imperfect mirror, one which offers false narratives and impossible images.  It was driven by a desire to build a piece of digital media acting as more than an archive or another form of literal representation of a space.  It is site-specific, drawing not just upon the architecture of the room but, more importantly, on the (im)possibilities of the exhibition location. 
 
 Approaching the work, it is useful to consider a constellation of influences including Dante’s Hotel, work by Lynn Hershman Leeson, the literary work of Laurence Ferlinghetti and critical explorations of code produced by Casey Reas. These suggest a way of engaging with transient spaces in poetic, evocative and playful ways.  This piece builds on those ideas, producing a reflection of transient physical spaces and remembered places by using unstable media. 
 
Nothing That is Not There uses archival imagery, histories, ambient location-based sound and texts from writers whose work was written in, or otherwise engaged with, the location of the exhibition. The piece is emphatically not ‘about technology’ but about encouraging reflection and consideration of moments now largely lost to history. 
 
The project builds upon my earlier interactive rephotography where I created exhibitions and CD Roms that layered archival and contemporary materials to suggest multiple and intersecting narratives in Lee Miller’s WWII images (Traces of Lee Miller: Echoes from St. Malo).

It was designed as an exhibition that made space for active interaction and reflection by visitors, and that generated new knowledge and understanding about the ways interactive rephotography can operate. The gesturally organized rephotographic space produced was designed to provide a series of digital interventions in archival photography and to inspire viewers to share their own experiences. 
Interactive rephotography is often used to explore ghosts and hidden narratives in urban spaces. Spaces that have seen significant cultural change are often evocative and have inspired sustained interaction pieces – notably Norman Klein’s exploration of Los Angeles in “Bleeding Through: layers of Los Angeles 1920-1986” project, (2003). Drift, drawing on this tradition, uses interactive rephotography, but this time not triggered by a mouse on a computer but by the presence (and relative absence) of the viewer. The exhibition attempts to suggest ways to experience the impossible histories of spaces which no longer exist, or that have seen great change. In this instance, locations used had seen waves of Italian and Chinese immigrants occupy the same space as authors, filmmakers and other cultural producers. These locations, holding importance to more than one of the communities now present, were identified, rephotographed and exhibited, specifically by employing performative/embodied movements to trigger movement through historical narratives. The accompanying sound was constructed from interviews and ambient recordings taken from historically relevant places and their residents.
In sum, the combined practices, methods, and showings of Drift represent an attempt to explore the development of methodologies for creating expanded or iterative histories of, and with, visual media as interactive media.

FQS is a peer-reviewed, multilingual, open-access online journal for qualitative research. 

This article discusses the four-year (2003-2007) research process towards Friend’s exhibition and publication Border Country (submitted for 2007 RAE). Border Country comprised a juxtaposition of photographs of immigration removal centre landscapes and interiors (devoid of people) with a fragmentary soundtrack of individual detainees’ oral testimonies.  

The submitted article on Border Country for REF 2013 constitutes new research. It provides a means for sociologists to understand how an artist develops a project: focusing in particular on the ethical, aesthetic and conceptual considerations involved in its editing, structure and final form. The article also explores Friend’s interview methodology and questions of power imbalance between artist and interviewee, critically significant in documentary practice. Whilst Friend published a short introductory essay on the Border Country exhibition in the accompanying publication, the new FQS article (9800 words) explores in detail for the first time how the work was made and through this makes new research claims. 

Eight photographs and five soundtracks are embedded within the online article;  these multimedia elements are regarded as essential to understanding the full import of the piece. 

It is therefore submitted as a PDF file (printed and included electronically) alongside audio clips embedded in the work (included separately as audio/image files). The full work, including all elements, may also be viewed at

The monograph and solo exhibition have different edits and emphases. 
Research started in 2008; 1500 medium format colour images were taken over four years 2009-12; extensive liaison with photographic laboratories took place 2009-13; academic research, editing for solo exhibition and monograph, sequencing, liaison with curators, printers, publisher, book designer, essayist and foreword writer was undertaken in 2013. The work involved a very intensive period of critical interrogation, practice and production.
",,,,,False,"There is widespread emphasis in recent photographic art practice on ‘aftermath’ photography in war zones (Seawright’s Hidden[i], Norfolk’s Chronotopia[ii]) but little on the normalization of war in the UK – how militarization is ‘woven into the fabric of civic culture’[iii]. The Home Front explores Susan Sontag’s ‘perennial seductiveness of war’, but on the home front, where weapons are detached from their purpose, sanitized, and employed for entertainment – and to aid military recruitment. The Home Front images expose the culture of militarism embedded in public air shows, organized as leisure events both at RAF bases, and at seaside resorts.
 Spectators at air shows are manipulated by the spectacle and the heroic endeavours of pilots – away from the realities of war. Displays by WWII bomber aircraft, whilst arguably commemorative, are interwoven with contemporary fighters to lend legitimacy to contemporary wars. On the ground, tank rides and opportunities to handle weapons are on offer; the public space of the beach becomes temporarily ‘militarized’ and the sky is ‘anything but reassuring’ as Pyrs Gruffyd[iv] put it, writing of the loss of innocence of the sky following WWII. The Home Front photographs, simultaneously aesthetic and disturbing, alluring and uneasy, express these contradictions.
The project critically re-frames UK involvement in recent wars (Iraq and Afghanistan). It also develops my own engagement with war and the visual, evidenced by exhibitions/publications Homes and Gardens: Documenting the Invisible, (1996), No Place Like Home: Echoes from Kosovo (2001), and Border Country (2007).

It consists of two online videos (Skipping ROPE (Through Hitchcock’s Joins) and Touching the Film Object) presented alongside versions of the same videos with added explanatory audio commentary tracks (transcripts are accessible on a linked webpage). 
The ‘original’ videos use quotations from existing film scholarship to explore the phenomenological and epistemological possibilities for theoretical and critical practices when these are performed synchronously with extracts from films using digital remix and compilation techniques. The ‘commentary’ videos offer further metatextual reflection on new videographic forms of film studies, pastiching commercial forms of documentary ‘infotainment’, which I have previously researched (C. Grant [2008], ‘Auteur machines? Auteurism and the DVD’, in Bennett and Brown [eds], Film and Television After DVD]), manifesting their essential ‘wordiness’ and tautological tendencies, and underscoring the argument of the work as a whole – which argues greater trust should be placed in less ‘verbal’ film scholarly forms.

As a public figure associated with self-fashioning and gay sub-cultures, Crisp is usually thought outside the heteronormative family, yet he kept close contact with generations of relatives. The film responds to questions of affect in queer theory, in particular queer bonds (Weiner and Young, 2011). It asks what intimacies emerge across generations, between gay and straight relatives, and between public and private personae. The research objective is to develop concepts of queer bonds in relation to a key figure from an older cultural model of homosexuality, one which is often seen as rejecting family bonds altogether. The film speaks from a personal point of view: as Crisp’s great-nephew, I ask the viewer to see a public figure in an oddly private context. I create new perspectives on Quentin by using interviews with family members, achival material from home movies and photographs, and excerpts from his unpublished final manuscript, The Dusty Answers. The formal choice to use a familial archive disrupts the public image of Quentin as a self-made man but it also disrupts the idea of the home movie as a mode of image-making centred on the reproductive family. Viewing Quentin in Super-8mm home movies queers the discourse of family photography, but it also asks the viewer to look again, to see a gay investment in these traditional modes of family intimacy and memory.

10007806,36,,3356651,Q,Personal effects,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,,1,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This installation recreates the Manhattan studio apartment of the English writer and gay icon Quentin Crisp. Following Berlant’s critique of public and private citizenships (1997) and Freeman’s concepts of queer temporality (2010), the project’s research objective is to interrogate received notions of queer space and to connect these to material histories of late twentieth-century bohemian culture in New York City. These issues are connected: Sarah Schulman has argued (2012) that the AIDS crisis in New York went hand in hand with gentrification to turn gay spaces into middle-class ‘family’ neighbourhoods, and to foreclose on the cultural space and time required for artistic practice and oppositional thought. Personal Effects recreates exactly the kind of non-conformist space that is now almost impossible in the Lower East Side neighbourhood in which it was installed. The piece remakes Crisp's private space: most items were owned by Crisp, and replicas have substituted those unavailable. On the television is a film portrait juxtaposing private home movies with public sound from Crisp's one-man stage show. Crisp had the public persona of a dandy yet his apartment was squalid and filthy. He viewed the world as a stage, so I chose to recreate this ‘backstage’ area to animate a tension between public and private, and to foreground a history of gay life very different from the Queer Eye culture in which gays provide interior décor advice for heteronormative homes. Recreating environments is a practice used by artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn and Guy Maddin to engage the politics and poetics of memory. Here, I deployed the technique to rethink gay histories, and to bring back to life a queer temporality of artistic decay. The installation was displayed at the Mix Queer Experimental Film and Video Festival (2010) and was viewed by over a thousand people. "
10007806,36,,3356652,M,Still live,"London, England",,,,,,,,,,,2010,,0,False,,False,True,,,,,,False,"Still Live is an experimental short film that uses various techniques to “re-animate” magazine imagery from the turn of the century. It sits within an experimental film tradition of repurposing found footage made famous by canonical avant-garde filmmakers such as Bruce Connor, Joseph Cornell and Guy Debord and more recent filmmakers such as Bill Morrison and Jen Proctor – but engages this experimental tradition in new ways. The film rephotographs glossy magazine images and manipulates them both optically and digitally to create an abstract collage wherein the original images gain a strange sense of movement. The intention of this process of forcible animation is first to explore the nature of the film image by blurring the boundaries between the still image and the illusion of movement inherent in motion picture technology – a relationship recently theorised by film scholars Jean Ma and Karen Blackman in their edited collection, Still Moving: Between Cinema and Photography (2008). The digital techniques used to do this draw on the work of Leighton Pierce and the optical manipulation was inspired by the tradition of Stan Brakhage, Ken Jacobs and more recently, Stom Sogo. Second, the film seeks, through innovative optical and digital manipulation, to re-present consumer culture itself as a form of hallucination – and here the project draws on the marxist analysis of Guy Debord (1967), Martin Jay’s notion of the denigration of vision in 20th century French thought (1993), and on readings of 21st century “zombie” capitalism (Comaroff, 2002; Harman, 2009). The film was screened as part of a live performance by the New Music Players at Kings Place in London as part of their Out Hear series. The soundtrack, entitled Quartet, was composed by Ed Hughes.

10007806,36,,3356653,Q,¡Viva Chile Mierda!,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,,0,False,,True,False,"The feature-length documentary, ¡Viva Chile Mierda! is eighty seven minutes long and involved a two-year-long production/research process. It was shot in three countries and makes a complex historical argument about the enduring effects of political violence, disappearance, and exile of Chileans affected by the Pinochet regime. It demanded time-consuming research work, including tracking down a key interview subject, who, until recently, was under the police protection of the French government and who was difficult to contact. The film includes many other interviews and uses extensive primary sources archival material – itself needing to be traced frame by frame and animated.",,,,,False,"¡Viva Chile Mierda! is a feature length documentary that investigates the enduring effects of torture and exile on a Chilean family. I interviewed Gabriela Cordova who was tortured in 1974 and one of the guards at her torture facility. The film explores how exile transforms cultural belonging while also locating this family story within a broader history of U.S. imperialism in Latin America. 

My research addresses three themes: the political weight of representing the past; the intersections of political violence and quotidian life; and the reconstruction of Chilean national identity in a postdictatorship era. It aims to produce new modes of representing this difficult history: the research context includes Sorensen (2009) on memory and human rights in contemporary Chilean media, as well as Guzmán’s documentaries on Chilean political memory. I use Rosen’s (2001) account of cinema’s inherent historicity to reconfigure documentary’s staging of pastness. Instead of providing ‘evidence’ through historical footage, the film uses drawings to represent the past. This technique formally evokes missing documents, as fleeing exiles were unable to bring family photographs and political violence went deliberately undocumented. Just as the film’s subjects were ‘disappeared,’ so were the visual records of their lives. Hand-drawing replaces mechanical reproduction to figure lost memories. By combining visibly subjective memory with the direct testimony of witnesses, I aim to synthesise cinematic issues of historical representation with the history of political violence in Chile. I juxtapose the media spectacle of the 2010 rescue of Chilean miners from deep below ground with the excavation of traumatic memories by both exiles and their torturers in order to question the post-dictatorship formation of Chilean national identity. Investigating these criss-crossing lives, the project argues that modern Chilean identity is affected by the histories of torture in more complex and ambiguous ways than we might expect.

From a boom in theatrical features to footage posted on websites such as Youtube and Google video, the early years of the 21st century have witnessed significant changes in 
the technological, commercial, aesthetic, political and social dimensions of documentaries on film, television and the web. In response to these rapid developments this book rethinks the notion of documentary, in terms of theory, practice and objet/s of study. Drawing together 26 original essays and interviews from scholars and practitioners, it critically assesses ideas and constructions of documentary and, where necessary, proposes new tools and arguments with which to examine this complex and shifting terrain.Covering a range of media output, the book is divided into four sections: 
1. critical perspectives on documentary form and concepts
2. the changing face of documentary production 
3. contemporary documentary: borders, neighbours and disputed territories 
4. digital and online documentaries: opportunities and limitations

Commissioned by CAPTURE, the national agency for dance on screen and Arts Council England, the research aims to interrogate what makes a moving image physically and emotionally. The photographs, shot on 35mm slide film, employed methodologies from early experiments in photographic movement (Muybridge, Marey). These depict successive shots of a moving subject to freeze movement in various states of clarity depending upon speed of shutter, film and subject. Working in collaboration with a choreographer, Still Moving captures three people’s movements that arise out of an experience of loss. Set within a domestic space, the environment also reflects these emotions through colour, lighting, costumes and construction. Presented on light boxes with internally mounted viewfinders, as video projections and a sound track, the practice methodology highlights the complexity of motion; performer, viewer and camera.  

Through isolating and manipulating pictorial layers (e.g. fixed frames, repeated fixed frames minus elements; performer, sets or costumes) and extending the experience of this movement through installation design (viewer movement as animating images through stereoscopic effects in light boxes) highly complex considerations of motion are developed.  Underlying research considered loss, isolation, and displacement through the existential philosophy of Nietzsche and Heidegger. Narrative construction, in the form of layering and delayering, drew on Borges (labyrinths) and Derrida (de-sedimentation) and aesthetically artists Tracey Moffat and Stan Douglas influenced the work. Premiered at FORMAT International Festival of Photography, Derby (2009) and exhibited at Moves, International Festival of Movement on Screen, Bluecoat Gallery Liverpool (2010). An image was published in the Sunday Times (29 March 2009).

In Timaeus, Plato proposes there exists a world of forms where ‘things’ exist as an essence or form, and a world of appearances where copies of these forms exist. Taking this as starting point the narrative of the film was a journey from the world of forms to the world of appearances. The research aims to mobilise Plato’s ‘eidos’ using the creative possibilities offered by the mise-en-scène, cinematography, music, performance and design, while reflexively acknowledging the limits of film language to grasp form or essence. Plato’s elemental essences (earth, fire, water) and somatic essences (plant, horse, human) are intercut with a Socratic dialogue between two characters, Stanley (the copy) and Stanley Too (the form). The dialogue and commentary contained within the film, articulated in relation to form and ontology in the context of the images, and in relation to iconography and sound design employed, exemplify ways in which film form itself is a subject of research process and outcome.    
Callaghan’s research is informed by arguments that film can engender philosophical practices (Cavell, Frampton and Singer). She argues that a reflexive use of film form allows thinking through of philosophical problems. The project was partly funded through an AHRC award. Presentations have included exhibitions, screenings and conferences at public venues including the Whitechapel Gallery in London, Centro Cultural de Lagos (Portugal), and Watershed, Bristol. Versions were published in Screenworks, Journal of Media Practice (2011) and reviewed on AP engine. Secondary outputs include a documentary and a book chapter for a pedagogic text.

10007806,36,,3356684,Q,DO NOT READ THIS,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,https://vimeo.com/43814622,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This 29-minute film addresses Jacques Derrida’s concept of trace; “Trace is not a presence but is rather the simulacrum of a presence that dislocates, displaces, and refers beyond itself” (Derrida, 1978: 403). The research  engenders trace through a controlled and highly manipulated use of film form. The fictional narrative portrays the search for a missing manuscript from a writer who is recently deceased. Like a simulacrum, the narrative appears on the surface to obey the demands for narrative coherence through story structure and execution.  However, troubling anomalies disrupt this coherence, dislocating the narrative and making present narrative construction. The film achieves this through practice methods that seek to ‘mechanise’ acts of writing and reading via story structure, editing and sound design. For example the narrative is of a writer who writes the story that we see, producing a story within a story.  The rhythm of the editing replicates the acts associated with using a typewriter (typing, return, pulling out a page), and does this through shot duration, type of cut (e.g. jump cut for ripping a page), and transitions. The sound design interrupts diegetic space through playing with sync sound, atmosphere and via other sound effects.  
These methods reflexively and actively ‘write’ the concept(s) of the narrative (the film we see and hear) and ‘read’ those concept(s) (how film sees and hears). In this way, the narrative refers beyond itself to wider notions of narrative, narrative construction, and narrative history. Callaghan’s research is informed by film philosophy arguments that film can engender philosophical practices  (Cavell, Frampton and Singer). She argues that a reflexive use of film form allows thinking through of philosophical problems. The film was presented to public audiences at the Electric Shadow Cinema, London and Wired Screening room (2012). Secondary outputs include a 10 minute documentation account.

The film was directed by Michael Chanan and grew out of the research of Lee Salter, who wrote and produced the film, as well as inputting into the editing and directorial process. 

The form and content of the film stems from three sets of research. Early research (from 2002 on), explored the Corporation and the City of London (Ward Elections) Act. Research was then undertaken into practices of radical media and digital mediation. Finally recent research (2012-2013) explored mediations of crisis. While the research into the Corporation formed the substance of the film, my research into radical media and digital mediations informed its aesthetics – specifically offering insights into how radical cinematic practices using digital media production can be developed to facilitate narratives of activists. Finally, the paucity of research on the role, influence, and power of the Corporation, meant much of the research conducted before the ideation of the film and during the process of researching the film is original, primary research; drawing on policy documents, on Hansard, on archival research, and on interview data.

The finished film investigates the history and constitution of the Corporation, its effects on social, cultural and political life, and its influence on economic processes up to the 2007 financial crisis, as well as forms of resistance to it. The film successfully incites responses both to the substantial issues presented and to the form of the film itself. Evidence of this is that we have been invited to present to Parliament, to the Green Party conference, at a plethora of activist events and festivals, to international film festivals, and have won Best Documentary Feature at the London Independent Film Festival.

The research fuses new cinema history and digital media practice, taking digital humanities research into the mobile arena. The Curzon Memories App contributes to the emerging field of “locative” heritage interpretation by preserving memories and making cinema history accessible to new audiences via mobile media - using GPS and QR codes to trigger situated memories. The interactive Projection Hero installation situates the spectator in the role of projectionist, inviting them to gain control of a miniature cinema’s curtains, lights and projector on their mobile device using sensors and actuators to connect to the internet. Both app and installation use the affordances of new internet-enabled mobile technologies as a means through which to examine the “old” cinematic apparatus (as theorised in the 1970s by Baudry, Comolli, Metz, Heath, etc) as rapid transition to digital projection means that traditional forms of 35mm exhibition and distribution are becoming obsolete (see Output 3).

The research has been presented at numerous international conferences in intersecting fields:

• new cinema history: Screen (Glasgow, 2011); MeCCSA (Salford, 2011); MeCCSA (Bedford, 2012 - where it won poster prize); Besides the Screen, (Keynote, Goldsmiths, 2012); History of Moviegoing, Exhibition and Reception Workshop at NECS, European Cinema Studies Network (Prague, 2013);

Published in 2008, the article was the first of its kind, dealing with the pressing issue of digital conversion which is now fully upon us – with film “cut–off” imminent and the very real threat of “digital shortfall” affecting many small independent “revival” cinemas around the world (see Julia Marchese’s petition to the major Hollywood studios to maintain 35mm release prints: http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/fight-for-35mm/). The “digital dilemma” identified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences remains unresolved.

Crogan contributed the 10,000 word introduction to the issue and an interview with Stiegler, and in collaboration with the journal managing editors oversaw the commissioning and review of the other contributions to the issue, including securing rights to translate a chapter from a book by Stiegler (still unpublished in English). 

Stiegler’s activist-oriented, philosophy of technology-based account of contemporary media and technoculture has become recognised as an increasingly influential current emerging in and across philosophy, cultural and media studies terrains in recent years (evidenced by a proliferation of English translations of Stiegler and as numerous subsequent special issues and anthologies have testified). The issue led the way in introducing and assessing the significance of Stiegler’s work in Anglophone critical and cultural theory contexts, being the first print-based special issue on Stiegler on its release. 

As set out in Crogan’s introduction (‘Bernard Stiegler: Philosophy, Technics, Activism’) this issue introduces key themes and concerns in Stiegler’s work by framing them as engagements in contemporary dynamics linking culture and politics in the globalised, digital epoch through a focus on the role of technology as mediator between these spheres. The interview (‘Knowledge, care and trans-individuation: An interview with Bernard Stiegler’) examines his approach to cultural politics from this perspective and draws out the implications for contemporary debates around politics, education, and digital media transformation of his redefinition of technology as irreducible prosthetic medium of individual and collective becoming."

It investigates the relationship of cycling, recycling and political asylum through the narrative representation of The Bristol Bike Project, and the stories of some of the political refugees who volunteer there. The film works as an agenda catalyst for these interrelated issues.

Practice-led research and aesthetic innovation tailored to the issues explored include the collation of diegetic sounds from a bicycle workshop which were then reformulated into a musical score; the use of a GoPro camera mounted onto the handle bar of a bicycle; and the use of telescoping of still imagery in AfterEffects to create a visual juxtaposition for personal testimony.

Once the film had been produced, new insights were gained into the deportation process of Afghan refugees to this country, the receptivity of audiences in Eastern and Central Europe to the film’s narrative aesthetics, and the manner of how a short film about a localised grassroots workshop in Bristol could find such a diverse international audience through the festival circuit, online distribution and international education programmes, all outside of the mainstream broadcast schedule. In this way, the film’s distribution, dissemination and exhibition has become part of the investigative process.

The film has played at over forty film festivals internationally (including in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Madrid, Seoul, Vienna, Munich, Lisbon (2009-2011) and has been translated into fourteen different languages.

After screening at the OneWorld film festival in Prague (2010), the film was distributed through OneWorld in Schools and People in Need, resulting in screenings throughout Central and Eastern Europe, including in schools throughout the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Armenia, Romania, Estonia and Georgia (March-December 2010)."
10007164,36,,1096036,Q,Bonnington Square,,,,,,,,,,,,2011,http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/18452/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This short film documents the evolution of a squatted community in the heart of London from the early 1980s into the model of an urban sustainable community that it is today. Through this the film enacts an excavation of memory of the squatting movement in London, whose traces have been effectively vaporised from the public sphere, as there is little recorded documentation of its existence.

The documentary process revealed how the squatters initiated action around environmental issues such as recycling, urban regeneration, food waste and urban gardening. It went on to explore how the memory of a transient community as it existed thirty years ago could be restored in narrative form. This entailed researching still photographs taken from twelve different photographers who were living in Bonnington Square at the time. Over 600 photographs, all of them predigital, were gathered and then reassembled into a multiperspectival narrative assemblage to describe the memory of the community.

The architectural location of Bonnington Square was also recreated by stitching together and degrading modern day digital photographs to create an animated sequence in After Effects as a transitional device to represent collective memory. These visual elements were then combined with oral testimony to reveal the community’s early engagement with issues of sustainability in an inner city environment.

The film has had multiple festival screenings including; Hawaii, Slovakia, Berlin, and New Zealand, as well as at London and Edinburgh Documentary Festivals (January-June 2012) and has been used as an agenda catalyst in various architectural, community development and sustainability forums (2012), including at the Royal College of Art, the Lambeth Archives open day, the Neighbourhood Renewal Conference at the University of Westminster, UWE’s Institute of Sustainability, the Architectural Film Festival in Lisbon (September 2013), and at the Festival of Neighbourhood in the Royal Festival Hall, London (2013)."
10007164,36,,1096041,Q,Invisible Airs,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/18453/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This short film was produced in collaboration with digital media artists YOHA (winners of the Berlin Transmediale), in a project commissioned by the Digital Cultures Research Centre and Bristol City Council to explore the nature of open data.

The film follows YOHA’s investigation into the relationship of computerised databases, expenditure and power, as they convert the pounds sterling of expenditure, into the pounds per square inch of pneumatic pressure, through the construction of a series of mechanical contraptions (eg a library book stabber, a potato cannon and an older people’s polishing machine) to be tested with members of the public.

The film provides context to YOHA’s contesting of the neutrality of data, particularly in this time of political conservatism and financial austerity, finding visual expression for YOHA’s site specific metaphorical investigations of the computerised database and bringing them to life to a wider audience. These explorations are part of a process of realising new perceptions about the role of data that YOHA claim are fundamental to the operation and distribution of power in contemporary society.

Accordingly, the film is an attempt to visualise these ‘invisible’ processes, not just through the documentation of YOHA’s installation performances, but also through the use of sound design, AfterEffects and tilt shift camera techniques to bring to life and make visible some of the processes which YOHA explore in their work. The use of analogue sound design in particular attempts to simulate YOHA’s use of deliberately engineered, mechanical contraptions by which to investigate the ethereal power of the database.

The film has been reviewed on the influential websites, humansinvent.com and creativeapplications.net, as well as being exhibited at a number of gallery spaces and screenings, including the Void Gallery in Derry, the Glasgow Centre for Contemporary Arts and the Furtherfield Gallery in Finsbury Park (March-July 2012)."
10007164,36,,1096046,Q,The Gardens of St George,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/18454/,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This output (completed August 2013) is the most recent in a series of documentaries exploring the cinematic representation of issues concerning sustainability and the environment. This film investigates the social and natural ecologies of an enclosed area of allotments in the St George area of Bristol which comprise the Asylum Seekers Allotment Project. It explores the relationship of a marginalised and socially excluded group of people to the practices of organic gardening, as a means of sustaining themselves psychologically and materially by growing food through the principles of permaculture and organic gardening.

As with Outputs 2 and 3, the film’s intention is to explore the intersection and interrelatedness of seemingly disparate issues, in this case combining food, permaculture, political asylum and sustainability in a single narrative form. This process of investigation has also led to a consideration of how to represent the gardens as an allegorical space, whose practices represent the vision of a harmonious sanctuary hospitably combining people with nature. Its aesthetic and narrative structure is oriented to permaculture as a practice that shapes the embodied rhythms and sensory engagement with the garden alongside the interrelationships that arise from a communal project and the sharing of histories.

A Panasonic 101 Prime Lens camera allowed the use of interchangeable lenses, including macro sequences of extreme close ups to give a sense of the micro ecology of the gardening space. This is juxtaposed against creative recording techniques, including the use of disembodied testimony from the asylum seekers. The overall aim is to give the sense of a poetic and allegorical representation of a harmonious sanctuary that the garden presents.

The film will be distributed through Eastern and European film festival circuits, where some of the issues raised have a particular pertinence, as well as the burgeoning environmental film festival circuit.

The Project is a multi-year, multi-facetted exploration of the intersection between documentary and networked culture. Fifty years after Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin launched their seminal 1961 documentary, ‘Chronique d’un Eté’, at a new moment of technological change, Rose has gathered footage from filmmakers and film enthusiasts around the world who she invited to revisit or restage the vox pop sequences from that film.

Grounded by its reference to a previous moment of innovation, The ‘Are You Happy?’ Project provides a framework that elucidates the mix of continuity and novelty at play in digital documentary. The reference to Rouch also evokes his view of documentary as a process of collaborative meaning-making, which provides a context for a critical focus on the co-creative aspects of this work and of wider trends in crowd-sourcing documentary content.

The second stage of the project - launched in May 2013 - takes advantage of the latest generation of web technology (HTML5) to investigate the potential of live data for the “creative treatment of actuality” (John Grierson’s 1926 definition of documentary). Selected video contributions are combined through montage with social media – Tweets, Flickr images – drawn in ‘live’. In this version of the project, entitled ‘Searching for Happiness’, the use of social media provides live re-contextualisation of the video content, re-inscribing some of the social and cultural surround that is lost within the filming process. Based on search terms, the social media is contingent, specific and emergent, so that the user-experience of the documentary changes from person to person and moment to moment. In this respect ‘Searching for Happiness’ offers an enunciation of documentary as live experience and open text."

This three-month rapid prototyping ‘Sandbox’ resulted in three connected practice-based outputs, the City Strata Platform itself, the Cinemapping Pilot and the published Lost Cinemas of Castle Park App. The project was a Knowledge Exchange collaboration between Crofts as PI, creative economy partner Jo Reid at Calvium and heritage partner Peter Insole, historic environment officer at Bristol City Council.

City Strata is a new app development platform for designing different “layers” of location-based heritage interpretation. One of the problems with large-scale locative heritage apps is the data limit for publication (only 50MB for Android apps), which is often not enough to contain content-rich heritage experiences over a wider terrain. The City Strata platform addresses this by drawing data from ‘The Cloud’ rather than containing all the media within the app.

In this instance geo-referenced data was drawn from the ‘Historic Cinemas’ layer in Bristol City Council’s Know Your Place map (a Geographic Information System database of Bristol’s historic environment) to create the Cinemapping Prototype. The prototype app tested a single point of interest, The Whiteladies Picture House, as well as the ability to download data from multiple points of interest in and around Castle Park—the latter developed into the Lost Cinemas of Castle Park app, published in November 2012.

Building on the research of the Curzon Memories project, the Cinemapping Prototype and Lost Cinemas of Castle Park app contribute to the fields of New Cinema History, Locative Experience Design and Heritage Interpretation and the findings have been disseminated broadly at international conferences, including keynotes at Environmental Utterances (Falmouth, Sept 2012) and Besides the Screen conference (Goldsmiths, 2012), and an award-winning poster (MeCCSA annual conference, Ulster 2013)."

It explores mediation in terms of lived experience rather than text, by focusing on the phenomenology of embodied experience. Further, it organises its conceptual framing to replace the locative as the dominant analytic frame, with new theorisations of the audience/ user experience and the embeddedness of digital technology in everyday life. The findings of the research demonstrate that affect, illusion, attention, memory, place and context are all key fields for producers working with the emergent affordances of ambient mediation (McCullough, M. 2013 Ambient Commons, MIT Press) see Dovey and Fleuriot, 2013.

This work builds on Dovey’s leadership of a research group on the language of mobile media for the Department of Trade and Industry funded Hewlett Packard and University of Bristol ‘Mobile Bristol’ research project (2004), for which he developed a design framework for mobile media producers (Dovey & Fleuriot 2011). Dovey went on to design and lead an AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship with Bristol’s Watershed Media Centre 2010-12. The Pervasive Media Cookbook is the lead output of this co-creative research. The Cookbook is built around 14 case studies of media experiences delivered using a range of sensor and actuator devices, supported by 10 short contextualising essays.

The website has had 12,800 unique users since its launch in Feb 2012. Project findings have been presented to over 300 people through DCRC’s workshop, seminar and Summer School programme. Findings have also been presented at MECCSA (Salford, 2011), ISEA International Symposium on Electronic Art (Istanbul, 2011) and Transformations in/of Broadcasting (Leeds, 2012)."

Drawing on Documentary Studies and New Media Theory, the blog reflects Rose’s research into new online interactive and participatory documentary and the broader impacts of connectivity on the documentary environment. Rose’s observation and analysis of the fast-evolving field is grounded in her own current and past practice-based work. The research base also consists of the body of interviews Rose has conducted with leading practitioners in the field, published in full on the CollabDocs platform.

The central research insight which frames the blog is that the impact of digital for documentary is not only expressed at the level of form. The social, semantic and open web are between them producing an environment in which funding, form, process, authorship and distribution are all reworked, towards a new ecology of documentary practice. This central finding, applied with reference to Lev Manovich’s theory of digital transformation, finds expression in posts including “On Crowdfunding” (March 2012), and “Now the Field is Open” (Sept 2012).

Manovich and Henry Jenkins have both observed the tendency within digital culture for marginal twentieth-century cultural forms to be reinvented. Rose’s second key insight concerns the contemporary re-emergence and transformation of forms of community media and participatory art. Posts exploring this theme include “A Filmmaker-in-Residence” (April 2011) and “American Futures” (August 2013).

In this new environment Rose defines new forms of documentary in terms of emergent practices of co-creativity - “The Umbrella of Crowd-Sourcing” (Sept 2011), “Cloud Filmmaking” (Nov 2012) - in which an evolving participatory process takes precedent over a documentary product. The latter theme is addressed in posts including “An Interview with David Evan Harris” (Sept 2011) and “The Awra Amba Experience”(March 2013)."

The project comprised a writing experiment encompassing 60,000 words, fifteen minutes of video, four digital prints, and three websites.

In February 2011 cardboard tubes containing a 1m2 print on handmade paper, with a short story encoded in each artwork, were mailed to 120 recipients. Respondents to the invitation (typewritten on a library index card) for ‘more?’ received an SD card with fragments of text, video and images, and a roadmap to how to find the rest.

The ‘book’ comprised a metaphysical detective story with 167 separate fragments - strands of cut up fiction forced together to provoke connections and challenge story’s mandatory meaning. Drawing on work by BS Johnson (1969), Danielewski (1999) and Safran Foer (2010) and reconciling traditions of practice with the work of Janet Murray and Katherine N Hayles’ advocacy for the materiality of reading, the piece explores an assembling of meaning from dissolute story fragments. Each reader participated in reassembling the narrative, which could be restored in almost any order.

Offering a model for content development, the work was presented to a publishing and creative industry audience (Hachette, Bloomsbury, Faber & Faber, National Theatre, BBC, Google) as a provocation regarding form and content in digital writing. A concluding event at the Wellcome Trust (May 2011) drew an audience from The British Council, Random House, ifBook, Granta and The Royal Opera House. Read individually and as a collective experience (through reader-curated social media), the work was ‘live’ over three-months in Spring 2011."

Abba’s contribution builds on his previous work in this field, developing a literature of ambience within Speakman’s site-specific experiential narrative practice. 

Abba’s practice-led research critically addresses literary form in a digital environment. The work makes tangible the narrative framework outlined in ‘As We May Watch’ (Output 4), situating an audience’s imagination, presence and participation as hinges for interaction.
 
Abba’s curational contribution to the overall project was to originate formal techniques (including reader participation, platform interdependency, the role and form of the book) as part of a narrative design framework for the project. This was then employed by each successive artist to consider the convergence of digital and physical media as a specific platform as it related to their work on the project. 
 
The complete work begins with Abba’s authored piece: ‘Six Shots’; asking the reader to sit alone while observing a stranger whose life story is experienced through an auditory proxy. This and each successive ‘story’ explores the relationship between medium, site, and the material object held by the participant. 

The physical volume has an MP3 player embedded inside it, headphones attached. Inside the book are materials for each experience. A hand-made wooden box holds book, headphones and a magnifying glass. The completed work cannot be ‘read’ without navigating between multiple forms; readers can only reconcile the narrative by synthesising components of a cohesive whole. In this way, the work challenges norms identified with transmedia form, which hitherto have allowed readers to navigate independent media elements.

The two books provide an interdependent reading experience using the book – a wooden-bound physical artefact – alongside a digital text on a series of wireless hard drives hidden across a real city and read on a mobile device. The narrative emerges through interplay between the two platforms, and the reader’s physical participation (walking, watching, writing). The work transposes principles of digital interaction into experiential narrative situations, exploring relationships between a ‘fixed’ material book and ‘fluid’ digital text.

The body of work submitted contributes to research into the future of the book, the book as system (Craig Mod, 2011); and distributed narrative and immersion (Frank Rose, 2011). This output explores the specific affordances of digital in regard to situated reading, context (between the physical book and its digital counterpart) and a critique of the city as a mediated, pervasive space.

Abba is co-author of the project with Duncan Speakman (with contribution from Emile Grenier), with creative consultancy from Nick Harkaway and Neil Gaiman. It extends Abba’s focus on narrative design and the formal and grammatical qualities of a literature of ambience, reframing his work on the potential of digital technology to temper conventional storytelling platforms in the context of ‘transitional space’.

The work premiered in Bristol (April 2013) and sold out of its run, experienced by an audience of 200 paying participants. It has been demonstrated to academic and publishing industry audiences: Mix2 (Bath Spa University, July 2013), Publish 2013 (London.

Practically: faced with a Venezuelan avant-garde film, El Huerco (1962), reduced to fragments of degraded celluloid, but whose surviving score retains and in part ‘preserves’ it, could a contemporary film artist ‘restore’ and/or commemorate the original? Conceptually: how, through an experiment in audio-visual composition, using the filmic ruins and preserved score, could its (El Huerco’s) cultural/political moment (see REF3a/3b) re-acquire elements of its lost texture?

Methodology derived, in part, from Zubillaga’s ethnographic training. Interviews and archival searches treated the lost film and its utopian aspirations as a politico-cultural ecology whose legacy was recordable while participants and witnesses survived.  Another formative research component was Zubillaga’s desire to explore how the film essay could interrogate autobiographical and socio-cultural memory. That the score was composed by Zubillaga’s father, Luis (1928-1995), provided convergence. Given the lack of closure (qua Eco’s ‘Open Work’) in Zubillaga père’s music, MFMF sought a multiplicity of narratives, images, and voices; an unresolved ‘polyphonic’ account of El Huerco: a constellation presented as a ‘possible world’.

MFMF incorporates material from footage degraded beyond the extent commercial laboratories consider viable, signifying metonymically the overarching theme of loss/recuperation, with Zubillaga’s involvement in technical/artisanal restoration (at Film and Photo in Acton, West London) becoming part of MFMF’s response to its founding research questions. Footage from a RED camera using original El Huerco lenses (prominent in the imagery of MFMF), allied to multiple analogue techniques within the digital intermediate, make MFMF a practical and symbolic experiment with digital technology to re-enter the past; an operation interpretable, following Lyotard, as the ‘future anterior’.

",,,,,,,,,,,,2012,,0,True,,False,False,,"Issues explored in The Arousing of Thought emerged from Zubillaga’s interest in conjunctions and disjunctions of sound and image, and led to his research question: the limits of their interrelationship in promoting and prolonging semantic multiplicity.

Zubillaga began by exploring the possibilities of a generative encounter between the music and visuality Inspired by precursors in synaesthetic experimentation, with researcher-developed drawings suggesting the operations of transposition and transformation between musical and visual forms/modes of perception/ representation. The result was a 6-minute animation comprising the material derived from the digitally scanned semi abstract drawings, combined with acoustic material, amounting to several hundred layers of visual components and sounds.",,,,False,"TAOT returns to a musical source by the composer responsible for the acoustic raw material used in MFMF. The issues explored emerged from Zubillaga’s interest in conjunctions and disjunctions of sound and image, and led to his research question – namely the limits of their interrelationship in promoting and prolonging semantic multiplicity. 

Zubillaga began by exploring the possibilities of a generative encounter between the music and visuality. Inspired by precursors in synaesthetic experimentation (e.g. Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition), the researcher developed drawings suggesting the operations of transposition and transformation between musical and visual forms/modes of perception/ representation.
   
The result was a 6-minute animation comprising the material derived from the digitally scanned semi abstract drawings, combined with acoustic material, amounting to several hundred layers of visual components and sounds.  Zubillaga’s interest in exploring non-narrative, affective and visceral expression within the audio-visual domain underwritten by a musical continuum was emphasised by the occlusion of any identifiable locus of people, place, or period. For the screening at BIM, Zubillaga scanned and edited 16mm film remains and radio debates produced by the Grupos de Improvisación de La Plata, plus film segments from a rare Elda Cerrato 1971 animation. 

TAOT adds to a sustained preoccupation in Zubillaga’s work with the space between realism and abstraction. Using contemporary classical music and a form of cinematic ‘writing’ that eschews determinate semantic content (as here in the title and credits), abstract and figurative elements operate contrapuntally. TAOT constitutes an experiment in the possibilities of data management strategies to enable the sequencing of the imagery to respond to the music and thus to further the research question behind this work.

10006566,36,,2586976,Q,Cosas por Venir ,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,,0,True,,False,False,,"Exploring innovative means to express cultural memory, Cosas Por Venir (CPV) amplifies the question of memory in an explicitly political context. The dynamic interplay of fragment/whole, completion/incompletion and loss/intactness is explored in an expanded geographical context and across the platform of the long-format film.

CPV adopts musical notions of counterpoint, harmony, horizontal and vertical intensities, appropriate to describing the ambivalence of location and temporality. A unifying voice - narrator Hanna Schygulla - makes the stories cohere and paradoxically proliferate. CPV thus connects and juxtaposes ideas and characters linked geographically to a Berlin theatre and a memorial project to the ‘disappeared’ of the last Argentine dictatorship.",,,,False,"Building on the possibilities explored in MFMF of exploring innovative means to express cultural memory, CPV amplifies the question of memory in an explicitly political context. The dynamic interplay of fragment/whole, completion/incompletion and loss/intactness is explored in an expanded geographical context and across the platform of the long-format film.

CPV adopts musical notions of counterpoint, harmony, horizontal and vertical intensities, appropriate to describing the ambivalence of location and temporality, using Luis Zubillaga’s music as one source for the experimental exploration of image, sound, voice and narrative. A unifying voice - narrator Hanna Schygulla - makes the stories cohere and paradoxically proliferate. CPV thus connects and juxtaposes ideas and characters linked geographically to a Berlin theatre and a memorial project to the ‘disappeared’ of the last Argentine dictatorship.
 
Zubillaga presents the spectral presences as Bressonian ‘models’. Neither revenants, figments, nor Ruizian morts-vivants, they suggest the resistance and quelled activism of Argentina. They move between Europe and Latin America, between the 1970s and the present, between days of silenced political expression and nights of socializing mixed with activism. CPV consciously explores philosophical expressions of the ‘à venir’ (Derrida) and the ‘people to come’ (Deleuze and Guattari), utilizing iconic Argentine locations - associated with human rights violations, but recently transformed into revolutionary new spaces – and equivalent German sites redolent of international youth militancy. 

Aligned neither with art gallery film work nor the conventions of independent filmmaking, the project, which – as intended – has evolved between several high-profile screenings, has enjoyed positive responses at the IMT Gallery, Buenos Aires MoMA, Theater Vierte Welt. Audience feedback (from workshops, director Q&As) frequently centres on CPV’s arresting use of subtext and sound instead of dialogue. At IMT, CPV was presented as video installation for 4 projectors, located in 3 rooms/spaces.

Using research in Children’s Literature by Natov (2003), Goswami (2008) and Livingstone (2009) and in critical theory more generally, Melrose shows how Nodelman repeats critics such as Rose (1984), Lesnik-Oberstein (1994) and Nikolajeva (2005) in failing to acknowledge the difference between the experience of providing physical stimuli, and the mental abstraction of engagement, thought and development of the child-audience. In scrutinizing and interrogating that wider research he developed ideas that were merely introduced in Melrose (2002) into a more reasoned assertion."

Documentary Film,,Lanterna Magicka,,,,,,,,,,2011,,,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"The Druids is an exploration of neo-pagan magical belief in the 21st century. Shot over three years in Somerset, England, this ethnographic documentary follows a group of modern pagans and their friends through their celebrations of the ritual year in the West Country, home of stone circles, King Arthur and the Tesco supermarket chain. We meet informants such as Gordon (Tarot-reader and stone circles guide),  Liz and Trevor (druids and owners of three shops in Glastonbury), Adrian (druid and keeper of his own miniature henge) and Alison (druid and witch). 

The stories about their lives are interwoven with unique footage of ceremonies at Glastonbury (Gordon’s handfasting; Liz & Trevor’s May Day), and at Stanton Drew (home of the Dobunni Grove, a branch of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids). Each informant speaks frankly about the trajectories and interests that brought each of them to the West Country, and to their involvement in magic. The film explores how the activities and beliefs of the druids are rooted in contemporary attitudes to the landscape, Celtic prehistory, medievalism and the New Age. 

Super 8 footage of changing seasons and countryside is used to express visually first-person accounts of visionary and liminal experience, and for other kinds of subjective content. Original music, based on Somerset folksongs, arranged and performed by Jack Richold.

Following the boat on its eleven-hour voyage, we come to see it as a living story in itself – about island boats and boat builders, memories, legends and sea-roads – through interviews, storytelling and music.

The film deals with the renovation of a small Lewis fishing boat, Broad Bay, and its voyage to the Shiants in the summer of 2010. Digital HD footage of this voyage is cut together with interviews about memories and practices of traditional ship building on the Isle of Lewis, and with sections in Super 8 to convey a sense of time depth. Shot in super8 and digital HD with original music by Stornoway resident Peter Urpeth and by the famous Gaelic singer Ishbel McAskill.


This documentary was commissioned & shown at the Stornoway Art Centre, An Lantair, as part of the Creative Scotland funded exhibition Losses Three, curated by Ian Stephen.  Its British premiere was at the 13th Royal Anthropological International Festival of Ethnographic Film, 13-16 June 2013, Edinburgh, where it was shortlisted for the Material Culture & Archaeology Prize.

 The film uses a personal and occasionally poetic voice-over, a subjective interrogation of personal archive and public records, fragmented readings from historical memoirs, and mixed media (8mm film, HD video, photographs and documents) in its narrative construction of a personal research journey. These devices reflexively highlight the unreliability, instability and highly subjective nature of the interpretation and representation of historical records.
The participants’ voices are filtered through the scrutiny of the filmmaker’s evaluating voice-over. The act of interpretation and representation gathers significance from the reverberations that carry across generations of migrations/migrants and their constructed and evolving identities. 
Influenced by the personal, reflexive films of Agnes Varda (e.g., Ulysse) the film moves away from the radical deconstructing post-colonial gaze of a filmmaker such as Trinh T. Minh-ha. Instead, the film proposes a gentler, self-conscious, reflexive construction that personalises and takes ownership of colonial history. The authority of the narrative is not located at either end of the geographical spectrum of its story, neither in Scotland nor in India. Instead, the narrator’s voice emerges from beyond geography, from the place of a place-less migrant with diverse geographical histories and cross-geographical agendas of interest. This is reflected in the context of the film’s recent screenings in cross-border exhibitions and festivals with a focus on migrations, both in the UK and in Pakistan.

The underpinning research imperatives were: (i) an exploration, through practice, of seemingly opposing concepts of site-specificity and mobility and the potential of destabilising these apparent binaries in developing fluid yet meaningful understandings of place and identity; (ii) an exploration of multiple, changing perceptions and conceptions of the River Clyde and urban, post-industrial rivers more generally; and, (iii) an investigation into human/non-human interdependency and notions of non-human agency through devising and realising a performance with, on and for a river and a consideration of the implications of this approach in the development of nuanced and progressive ecological paradigms. The research findings were presented in the performance/installation which took the form of an attempt to lace together the banks of the River Clyde using over one mile of thick mooring line, dragged back and forth across the river by a workboat and tensioned around bollards - relics of the Clyde's maritime and industrial heritage - on facing quaysides, to create a zigzag lattice of rope spanning the watercourse.

The focus was on specific examples of heritage site: spaces/places whose concrete fabric is marked by their varied and shifting roles, sites that act as triggers to multiple, competing memories and where investments and interests remain contested and unresolved. The project sought to consider the efficacies of site-specific practice as a means of critiquing conceptions of (heritage) site as fixed or circumscribed, and thus as a means of resisting the perpetuation of dominant narratives and their attendant ideologies. The research findings were presented in the interconnected performances/installations Pianola Karaoke; Shoebox Archive; Façade Fruitmachine; Real Estate; Tramway 1; Tramway 2; Throughout the Ground Floor; Entrance/Reception Area
As a practice led project the research aspects of the performances/installations are evidenced by this portfolio of material:
1a/ a print catalogue edited by the researcher and including work written or commissioned by the researcher as well as a DVD documenting the project: Glimmers in Limbo, ed. (Glasgow: Tramway Publications, 2009);
1b/ an essay written by the researcher on the performances: 'Pianola Karaoke and Other Attractions: Resisting the Homogenisation of Cultural Memory Attached to Material Sites' in Performance, Embodiment and Cultural Memory, ed. by Colin Counsell and Roberta Mock (Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars' Press, 2009), pp. 183-202;
1c/ archive documentation of Glimmers in Limbo consisting of 10 x DVDs bringing together material relating to the development, realisation and reception of the site-responsive installations/performances at Britannia Panopticon, Glasgow and Tramway, Glasgow
The project is also archived at http://www.glimmersinlimbo.co.uk/ where further documentation describes the research undertaken.

It then considers interpretations of such works and rejection of their collective definition, by drawing attention to their socio-political and bioethical context. Finally, the paper consider how one may interpret the significance of bioart as a new creative medium.",,,,False,Full translation available

Gentle Actions explored inclusive and collaborative ways of working  with an interdisciplinary and ecological approach to environmental issues, finding new methods to investigate the complexity and breadth of our environmental crisis from a cultural perspective. Participants included artists, activists and environmental philosophers from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Finland, the US, and the UK including: David Abram (US) David Rothenberg (US) F. David Peat (Italy) Alan Boldon (UK) PLATFORM artists collective (UK). 

I was invited by the curators to make a contribution under the subheading ‘Metaphysical Space’, alongside US-based artist Ann Katrin Speiss and Norwegian ecophilosopher Per Ingvar Haukelland. The work I developed in response to this invitation and evolving from correspondence with Spiess and Haukelland, was a series of spoken word recordings which I uploaded from my home in Scotland during the period of the project as it unfolded in Olso. Listening stations were available for  visitors to the exhibition, and a blog site with links to the Gentle Actions website provided online remote access.

 My decision not to travel physically to Oslo but to participate by staying still, was motivated by the proposition that in response to ecological crisis, while our first instinct is to urgently think of actions we must take to try to fix the problems, in fact the most ecologically sensitive course of action may sometimes be to consciously  refrain from action. Inspired by the Pablo Neruda poem ‘Keeping Quiet’, my own ‘gentle action’ was to refrain from travelling to Oslo but instead to write and record a series of meditations on stillness, slowness, silences, pauses and the breath.

The aim was to work through the four stages outlined by Goethe in the observation of a familiar and largely ignored phenomenon (the river as it passes under busy city bridges) to see if his process of deliberately setting aside assumptions and theories would allow fresh insights to arise. Working through the stages Goethe outlined resulted in an understanding of how the river presents two distinct phenomena – its shimmering, responsive surface, and its implacable and impenetrable substance, the body of cold water subject to current and tide. This perception of the resolute ‘otherness’ and strangeness of the cold, black river as it quietly and powerfully bisects the city centre of Glasgow resulted in the development of a video work. The video is comprised of a slow-paced edit of the motion of artificial light from shops and riverside flats reflected from the black water’s surface as it changed according to weather and tidal patterns. During the development of the work, a series of video clips were sent to the Italian violinist and composer Guiseppe Iacono, who developed a seven minute score in response. His score shaped the final edit. The video was selected for inclusion in the screening “Echo Presents…” at the Collective Gallery, Edinburgh in February 2009. It was screened again at the Castello Aragonese, Ischia in 2009 with a live performance of the soundtrack."
10007800,36,,1145201,Q,"Lux Audiovisual artwork (video)
Interdisciplinary collaboration
",,,,,,,,,,,,2012,,1,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"Lux is an audiovisual artwork by artist Alison Clifford and composer Graeme Truslove; it is the third work in the Interstitial Articulations series exploring aspects of the interstitial through collaboration. Lux focuses on combining contrasting visual aesthetics realised separately in earlier works in the series. It proposes a new interstitial language based on direct translations of textures in the audio matched with abstract visual forms present in the source photograph. 

The work builds on visual aesthetics explored by early visual music pioneer, Thomas Wilfred in his lumia compositions. Whereas Wilfred’s compositions are the result of direct manipulation of light, Lux explores this digitally. The challenge was to unify the organic aesthetic expressed in Substratum with the more synthetic aesthetic of the 3D environment, expressed in Palimpsest. This was investigated through dynamically driven animation, working with 3D software simulations of natural forces to animate the light-forms. Further textural effects translating interstitial elements in the source image were achieved working with fluid simulations.

Audio for the work was selected from Truslove’s microsound compositions by ‘matching’ sonic textures to visual forms. Using techniques of reduced listening (Schaeffer) individual sound-layers were linked to visual elements; the final work was constructed by carefully combining these elements to synchronise with the audio using montage techniques.

Lux continues investigations of the computer as a collaborator in the creative process. Through the use of fluid simulations and dynamic animation, the computer contributes to the final work by presenting varying visual responses that could not otherwise be created.

Lux was shortlisted in the final 10 artworks for the Lumen Prize an international award for digital art, and was exhibited internationally as part of the Lumen Prize exhibition. It was also exhibited at the Hypersonica Event in Sao Paulo, at FILE International Electronic Language Festival.

Palimpsest focuses on mechanical form and its translation to 3D space, considering how gesture in sound might be used to manipulate the visual experience. The work continues and expands on audiovisual experiments by visual music pioneers, the Whitney brothers.

Building on findings from Substratum, which explored aspects of organic form through programming, Palimpsest explores mechanical form through 3D modeling, computer animation and programming. Using 3D software, a virtual light sculpture was created based on Clifford’s translations from the source photograph.  A fixed video sequence was then created that experienced the sculpture from a range of perspectives. Palimpsest was constructed from recordings of different ‘journeys’ through the video in response to the audio. This was realized by means of a custom-made software instrument designed to remix the visual materials by synchronizing them to significant events in the audio. As a result, the sculpture appears to ‘perform’ to gestures in the audio, consequently contributing new methods and aesthetics in audiovisual art.

The work establishes a synthetic aesthetic characterized by representations of synthetic qualities in the light-forms rather than being driven by any aims at photorealism. It therefore considers newer models of visual representation offered by the computer based on mathematical modeling, exploring how the computer ‘sees’ the world. 

Palimpsest was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to accompany Brian Stefans' (UCLA) series on digital literature – ‘Third Hand Plays.’ The series introduces new forms of art to a wide “art-engaged audience”, and is archived on SFMOMA’s Open Space.  It has also been exhibited at Seeing Sound, Bath Spa University, co-curated by the Centre for Visual Music, Los Angeles.

The collaboration is based around a series of photographic light paintings captured at night, investigating their interstitial  nature through processes of reinterpretation and remediation in new digital contexts. The series proposes new ways of visualising and understanding notions of the interstitial articulated through new audiovisual responses. 

Substratum is a time-based reinterpretation of the source photograph . It extends and combines creative strategies previously realized in the fields of generative art, visual music and microsound composition with regard to the creation and manipulation of form, resulting in new possibilities in audiovisual art. Clifford analysed and interpreted photographic light-forms based on their composition as individual lines of light-grains. She then translated this into computer algorithms generating subtly varying moving-image sequences with each new execution. Montage techniques common to filmmaking were subsequently employed to combine and remix sequences in response to the audio. 
Similar methods were used to construct the audio: sonic grains were extracted from samples of acoustic instruments that were decomposed into their lowest units, demonstrating variation in motifs and phrases of improvised performance (i.e. the performer’s own sound or individual approach), these fragments were combined with granular processes to create the final composition.

Substratum investigates how human interpretation informing a creative work might be translated and extended by the computer, considering unpredictability and variation in form through programmed approaches. The role of the computer as a collaborative partner is therefore explored.

Substratum has been exhibited worldwide, including the International Electronic Language Festival, Sao Paulo, attracting over 800,000 visits, and the International Conference on Generative Art, Milan.

The Northern Lights project set out to discover how questions of Scottish identity and citizenship might be communicated by members of the general public through the medium of documentary filmmaking.
In particular, the project sought to engage members of the public often unable or disinclined to respond to such questions. This was achieved by running a series of filmmaking workshops with targeted communities; including those from deprived areas, those with mental and physical disabilities, those from black and ethnic minorities, those who live in rural areas and those members of the community over the age of 65.
In total 55 filmmaking workshops were delivered during the three-month submission period. The result of this, and the open call for submissions to the general public, generated over 300 hours of documentary footage that was then edited down over 6 months to create the 98 minute feature documentary, We Are Northern Lights.
Whilst individually the footage from participants is of interest, once unified within the feature film, there is undoubtedly a representation of Scottish identity and culture the likes of which has never been seen before. 
Following from the insights of post-structuralist theorists for whom identity remains a fluid and ever evolving concept, except, as the work of Michel Foucault has so clearly demonstrated, when the state imposes identities upon individuals or groups, the project sought to create a framework whereby individuals could express themselves through creative practice rather than find themselves restricted by the limitations of textual or bureaucratic definitions. 
The benefits of the project are therefore twofold; both in terms of research output and considerable ongoing social impact. The film is the first ever Scottish documentary to receive a theatrical release from the Cineworld cinema chain.

",,,,,,,,,,,,2008,,,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This practice-based research output builds on Higgins’ monograph, Understanding the Chiapas Rebellion: Modernist Visions and the Invisible Indian (first published by the University of Texas Press in 2004). Continuing his investigation into the dynamics that engender cultural (in)visibility as presented in the book, Dr Higgins adapts his methodology to explore the affective possibilities that can be achieved through the creative practices of documentary filmmaking. 

The intellectual question of how best to achieve a cultural, political and emotional understanding of a heavily mediatized and ethically complex event such as the massacre at Acteal, was what drove the research project. Dr. Higgins had interviewed survivors from the massacre as early as 1998 during his original fieldwork in Mexico and had felt frustrated by the limitations of the academic text to communicate the experience of this very particular Mayan Tzotzil community. This experience is related in the text, ‘Tell Our Story to the World’ in Film Festivals and Activism, (St. Andrews College Gate Press, 2012).

Gathering original footage, researching news and private archives, and most importantly gaining the full trust of the community in Acteal involved over 5 years of research and 5 separate field trips supported by various grants from the British Academy and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation amongst others. 

Finding a cinematic language that could both communicate the cultural particularities and emotional sensitivities by which the Acteal survivors experienced the event whilst equally revealing the clandestine governmental machinations behind the creation of the paramilitary perpetrators of the crime was a the principal research challenge.

The final feature length documentary premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, screened at over 40 international festivals, has been broadcast on 4 international television stations and has received distribution in Europe and the USA. It was also awarded the best Human Rights Documentary Award in 2008.

Designed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, this documentary project set out to explore how human rights might be represented in contemporary Scotland. To fully explore the question of audio visual representation in relation to human rights, Dr. Higgins gathered together some of the most acclaimed artists and documentary filmmakers at work in Scotland today and asked each to select an individual human right and then he collaborated with them to find a cinematic approach appropriate to particular human rights. 
Collaborating with artists as diverse as the Oscar winner, Tilda Swinton, Turner prize winner, Douglas Gordon and novelist Irvine Welsh, the final project offered a double insight; not merely into human rights in Scotland itself but also in terms of innovative documentary practice. Raising funds from the BBC, Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts council, Dr. Higgins was able to deliver on his original research idea, exploring the abstract concept of Human Rights through documentary practices as diverse as observation, animation and conceptual filmmaking.
This twin trajectory of the research project was further supported by the publication of a companion publication, Learning Through Film: Human Rights in Scotland (2011). This audio-visual education resource sought to make explicit the key relationship between the manner in which a subject is represented and the understanding such a representation in turn generates.
The award winning film and book are currently used within the Police, NHS, Prison service, community groups and many secondary schools as a means to both discuss and critically consider both human rights and there mediated communication.

Using post-colonialist theory (Fanon, Said) and feminist/post-feminist (Sedgwick, Butler) constructions of identity, it proposes the serial killer as the result of social manufacture and defines his robotic, programmed behaviour as the result of the social formation of masculinity. 

Research traced the character of the killer protagonist in fiction, from classical through Romantic and Modernist literature to contemporary Post-Modern versions. It examined the effects of isolation, industrialism and class on the formation of the archetypal character of the serial killer, taking as its predominant symbols the opposition of metal and flesh. It included war and the study of the soldier in action, especially the slaughter of World War 1. One of the killer’s inevitable actions, burial, especially where it referred to the body, became a key motif:

…buried bodies must make fertile ground in any fiction, but especially
 in work dealing with the missing, the haunted or the psychologically interred.

Lost Bodies/Social Critique: a critical introduction, unpublished, 2011

This investigation was undertaken within the frame of current debates on the representation of the male in fiction. Ultimately this gave rise, in the original fiction, to the portrayal of a ‘hero’ as a series of false fronts in the sense of unyielding outer surfaces: armour, glass, knives, tools, tiles, stone and lack of communication. These outer skins cut off internal humanity and prevent any kind of a breakthrough between spirit and body, thought and flesh.  Over-determined, the killer male (and, possibly, female) is condemned to function along ever-faster pre-programmed lines: to undergo a spiral of killing, and endure escape or capture.

It draws upon research developed in Manderson’s novel Lost Bodies and other works. The thread of Scottish literary studies draws on post-colonialist theory (Fanon, Said) but also New Historicism, where the production of a text is viewed as a matter of social politics, intricately linked with national, social and sexual identity (Riach, Brown, Gifford, Daiches). This thread is only one of many making up the weave of Scottish studies, and the particular line of research followed towards this story is to do with the pressures and conflicts within Scottish identity during the build-up to the referendum in 2014. One individual’s attitudes, identity and stance are examined in the light of contemporary national, social and sexual politics. The importance of the formation of a sense of Scottish identity through history (Devine) (Schoene); the formation of sexual politics through interactions which are fundamentally divisive and based on power (male gaze); and the religious and social schisms which form a particular imperialist resistance to the idea of ‘independence’ are all examined through the inner thoughts of a character who has no idea of why he is the way he is, other than the belief that his thoughts are ‘natural’. (Schoene) 

The research develops themes in Lost Bodies and Best Man and brings them into the contemporary politics. Unexamined matters of a character’s gender, sexuality and culture form his armour-clad and warrior-like identity which can neither negotiate change nor contemplate its own negation, and so becomes an impossible rigidity which he must maintain (Schoene).

The story contributes new knowledge in that it configures this particular mix of queer, post-feminist and post-colonialist ideas within contemporary politics and reveals the ‘logic’ of a particular sub-culture’s resistance to tolerance and its continuing support for imperialism.

Turbulence combines findings and methods from earlier works in the series to create a work that embodies ideas of the interstitial in terms of the aesthetic approach and the technological processes used to communicate between audio and visual.

In Turbulence, Clifford translates abstract light-forms in the source photograph  into moving image fragments that represent different layers in the audio. These were constructed using a combination of techniques: particle systems in Maya (3D software) were used to create the slower moving background forms, whilst the frenetic foreground activity in the audio was represented by tubular forms animated using dynamics (specifically Maya’s wind simulations). 

The audio is an extract from an acousmatic work, composed using techniques common to microsound composition. In previous works in the series, visual elements were constructed then matched to elements present in the audio. With Turbulence however, by means of a custom-built software interface created with Max/MSP, the audio drives motion through the visual material, forming synchretic (Chion) relationships between sound and image.

The final work consists of a montage of these different responses from the interface, combined and edited together with more deliberate ‘human’ responses linking audio and visual. It is through the interaction between human and computer responses that new interstitial aesthetic possibilities for audiovisual art are proposed.

Turbulence was exhibited at the third Seeing Sound event at Bath Spa University, alongside screenings of the work of visual music pioneers, John and James Whitney.

These three original short stories published for the first time in digital format enlarge and expand on the themes outlined in the novel Lost Bodies. They reassemble these elements into a single story with three strands, or a novella in three parts. 

The research here expressed as creative practice continues threads of post-colonialist and post-feminist theory and introduces Queer Theory. 

‘Inkerman’ is set in an industrial and post-industrial setting and deals with the reality of employment, unemployment, family and industrial processes, society and the environment being formed by waves of historical change. A man sets out to protect his family by stealing a whole car, one piece at a time, from the factory where he works, in a race against time before a change which has happened before returns, and the factory closes.

‘Best Man’ is a comedy about men’s relationships expressed in events and causes usually pigeon-holed as female. Two male friends pass an eating disorder from one to the other. As their fortunes fluctuate, so does their weight. Love, respect, success and wealth bring health; their opposites bring isolation, failure and addiction to food. 

‘The Other’ is the story of an impossible friendship. Two men of different sexualities attempt to understand each other, but the sexual divide with the AIDS virus at its height cuts across many more social norms than either of them can deal with. Illness and the threat of death - or, even worse, recovery - split their routes beyond repair.

Scottish in setting, the places, relationships and events could happen anywhere.

One of the content studies involves a three week sample of BBC and ITV coverage of the 2008-9 Gaza War [chapter 6, p336-368]. The other examines a week's BBC and ITV coverage on the attack on the Gaza flotilla in 2010 [chapter 8, p381 -393].

In the 1960s sociologists surveyed a sample of 'affluent workers' in Luton at Vauxhall Cars, Skefco Engineering and Laporte Chemicals. Luton was, at this time, a boom-town with the car industry being the dominant manufacturer. By the time Fiona Devine, revisited Luton in the 1980s, the place and the people were struggling in the economic decline of that decade and the car industry was half its size. More than 20 years further on, Harrison and her collaborators found that Luton had become a very different place, no longer affluent and no longer as reliant on the motor industry.  As to the affluent workers of past studies, many had long since retired and the programme explored what had become of their children."

A questionnaire was devised to investigate how Blipfoto users started daily photography, how and why they continued and what they felt they had achieved through their endeavours.  Further questions sought more in-depth responses regarding the types of images they took, how much they considered the audience for their work and how far their interactions with other Blipfoto users contributed to their experience.

The artists were Jane Bustin, Simon Callery, Rose Davey, Lothar Gotz, Tamas Jovanovics, Karoly Kerseru, Dillwyn Smith and Estelle Thompson. The investigation of ‘abstract/geometric’ is central to the Hungarian ‘MADI’ movement and so references a specific historical movement.

Colour proposal for initial research and concept designs and stage; 2. Detailed designs for proposed floor treatment to enhance ‘way finding’ throughout three storey hospital; 3. Concept design and development of exterior facades; 4. Concept design and collaboration with Hoare Lea (lighting specialists) on main entrance/canopy lighting proposal. These themes were concerned with integrating colour into the architectural framework and environment. In addition to aesthetic concerns, each considered way finding, area identity, colour psychology, and colour theory. Research involved initially identifying concerns for development and specifying means to integrate these solutions into the architectural fabric. Colour was proposed to assist with coding a complex building for the broad demographic of visitors and customers, as well as resolving issues the architects had with way finding on the exterior and interior of the building. The universal and democratic language of colour was central to the concept as a means to bypass the conventional use of written language to identify areas. The colour spectrum - from prismatic light being red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet - was s elected to identify areas (wards, out-patients, etc). These are commonly and instantly identifiable colours.  A prismatic structure (usually identified as a radiating set of coloured bands) was used in the way finding floor design, radiating from the reception hub/desk throughout the hospital. The design for the exterior facades also referenced light – in this instance, the gradation of panels running along each side and wrapping around the corners implying light and shadow cast on the facade. The lighting project proposed at the entrance used cutting edge technology to project light gradating through the spectrum on a slow cycle, to evoke shifting colour and the potential of colour change embodying time passing."

The augmented reality browser developed through the project, layers historical photographic documents relating to the shipbuilding heritage of Belfast to their modern day scene at Belfast Harbour. The harbour site, formed materially through the shipbuilding heritage of the Harland & Wolff Company, symbolically connects the city of Belfast to the legacy of the Titanic. In leveraging the potential of location awareness and mobile network connectivity to frame the communicative interaction between real world places and data-spaces, the visual system created by the augmented reality browser is an attempt to mediate a place-making experience that connects the user of the technology to the histories contained within the place in which it is operating. By layering historic photographic images viewed in the place from which they were captured at a different time in history, the potential of the system lies in the interactions of these two systems; the depiction of the past, and its rendering in the present. 
As the photographic element forms a constituent part of the mediated system constructed by the augmented reality browser, this project is also an exploration of the continuing impact of the digital revolution in relation to new renderings of the photographic document. By focusing on the continuing shift from perception via concrete media systems, to juxtaposed reconfigurations of the virtual and the real, the project further debates the intrinsic link between meaning and information in assessing photography in the digital realm.

The policy paper was written to assist the Northern Ireland Assembly's Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure in the above inquiry which began in September 2011. Six working papers were researched to feed into the document as it had to comply with the committee's format, questions raised and word length. Summary data for three of them are in the appendices while some information from the others was given to the committee at two oral hearings to which the author was invited. Links to the Hansard transcripts of these sessions are given below.

This policy paper focused on the creative media sector while others in the University looked at art and design, architecture, innovation policy and performing arts.

The committee's final report in February 2013, see link below, quoted seveeral parts of the policy paper including its growth projections and recommendations on skills development and the more central role in policy development and encouraging collaboration which the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure could play. It also contains, in Volume 2 pages 828-834, a copy of the policy paper.

It investigates ways in which regions with small arts sectors and museum infrastructures can create innovative, forward thinking, playful interactions for visitors. This body of work, discussed as a case study for the paper ‘This is Our Playground: Recognising the value of students as innovators ’, looks to develop new collaborative methodologies for both the Higher Education and the Museums Sectors drawn from the Digital Humanities (such as interdisciplinary studies, connected learning, collaborative proof of concept development). In this way, the project explores new approaches to R&D (Hack Days, rapid prototyping, fast iterative design for proof of concept, and spatial interventions) as alternatives to more traditional approaches such as internships and work placements.

The body of work consists of:
•	A peer reviewed paper first presented at the Museums on the Web Conference in Portland Oregon and available online. 
•	A series of site interventions (with the Foursquare Mayor Chair as a case study) to promote physical and digital projects which are easy to replicate and iterate,  and which look to promote social media engagement and increase visitor dwell time.
•	A one day piece of Action Research undertaken at the Museum of Ulster looking at students as innovators, and exploring approaches to collaborative research and development between sectors to foster growth and innovation.
•	Dissemination of research at a number of Conferences and events (Managing Employability in a Changing Landscape, CultureTech Festival, MCGPlay) to help promote the approach to the sector.

The project worked with advice from the author Ciaran Carson using his original text, 'The Star Factory', which was re-imagined and reinterpreted by locating it back into the spaces of the city that inspired it.  The body of work consists of:
•	The game, itself, which took place through a series of emails, websites and across social networks. This was designed to lead players through the narrative and help them to investigate the text and city in new ways. It engaged with new approaches to 'dispersed' storytelling and authorship, using feedback from the audience to develop the narrative and puzzles as the story unfolds
•	The play The Water Clock which investigated new ways to use the audience to document and achieve networked location-based theatre and live events through crowd sourced footage (available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6uANpnwmA8)
•	A live storytelling event Constellations of Belfast which facilitated live story development in collaboration with writers Ciaran Carson and Glen Patterson to close the game narrative and give authorial control to the players.

10007807,36,,1230833,Q,Unseen Women:  Stories from Armagh Gaol (26mm linear documentary and multi-screen gallery exhibition),,,,,,,,,,,,2011,,1,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"Unseen Women: Stories from Armagh Gaol, is a 26min documentary and multi-screen gallery exhibition containing the stories of seven women who experienced prison during the Troubles, edited from interviews filmed on-site at Armagh Gaol in 2006 for Cahal McLaughlin’s Prisons Memory Archive (PMA).  This research furthered the work carried out during Unheard Voices, especially in relation to researching appropriate editing strategies that would bring contrasting memories of a contested space to the public in a context where interpretations of the past can compete.  The editing strategy involved selecting self-contained narratives from the PMA recordings.  The selected clips sought to personalise and humanise each woman, encouraging the audience to see as her an individual rather than solely in the context of her role in the prison as either prisoner or staff.  Identifying titles were avoided other than the woman’s name when she first appears on screen.  Novel exhibition methods were also researched and adopted.  During an exhibition at Belfast Exposed gallery held in June 2011, the 6x5min linear documentary was shown alongside the full PMA recordings from which the clips were edited.  This exposed the editing process itself, allowing the audience to compare and contrast the linear film with the ‘raw’ material.  This practice-led research demonstrates that collaborative protocols alongside the novel 6x5min editing framework and exhibition methods creates new and inclusive ways of remembering the contested past in Northern Ireland. The accompanying on-line journal article adds further information and detail to the research strategy and working methodology."
10007807,36,,1230835,Q,Unheard Voices (30 min linear documentary),,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,1,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"Unheard Voices, is a 30min documentary containing the stories of six individuals who either lost someone or were themselves injured during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  This practice-led research sought to find appropriate methods of filming, editing and exhibiting memories of people from both Protestant and Catholic backgrounds in the complex context of post-conflict Northern Ireland where interpretations of the past can compete.  The research adopted collaborative protocols by sharing ownership of the material with participants and their organisation, WAVE Trauma.  Additionally, participants were offered a full veto, or the right to withdraw from the process at any time and were all given shared editorial control.  The novel editing framework devised for this piece consisted of 6x5min short stories that were not intercut.  This allowed audiences to view narratives that, whilst they shared the commonality of loss, were potentially contrasting; and also allowed participants’ stories to maintain their own integrity.  Screenings, held throughout Northern Ireland, and also in Great Britain and the USA, facilitated discussion between the film’s participants, production team and audiences, thereby creating a shared, non-divisive public space to reflect and process the impact of the Troubles.  The accompanying book chapter explores in detail the research objectives and working methodologies  behind the film's unique and original approach to audience participation and collaborative audiovisual storytelling.

10007807,36,,1231130,Q,NLR film,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"NLR is a development of my interdisciplinary research into the intertwining of memory, history, politics, economics and representation in the production of urban space. Drawing on strands in experimental Northern Irish and British filmmaking (e.g. Robin Wylie, Bill Miskelly, Alan Clark, Patrick Keiller), and on diverse readings of the urban generally and Belfast specifically (Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, Nigel Thrift, Guy Debord; Emrys Jones, Greg McLaughlin & Stephen Baker) it arrives at new ways of constructing and communicating imaginative knowledges, through innovative, experimental elaboration of filmic narrative and space. 

NLR defines a highly original area of research: how to foreground and explore through film the contradictions shaping urban space, in a part of the city explicitly framed by its monolithic political self-image, without simply repeating that image as visual cliché. A primary aim of NLR is to discern, examine and produce new ways of understanding the ‘unity of atmosphere’ of a specific enclave of the city. To do this it must not only formulate strategies for exceeding the representational habits of a city where ‘Politics’ is so narrowly defined, and where representation became such a predictable affair; it must adopt an entirely new approach. This experiential, syncretic method, which informs and is informed by my written research (see Jewesbury & Porter), is quite distinct to prevailing social-scientific analytical models of ‘post-conflict’ Belfast (e.g. Peter Shirlow, Dominic Bryan).
Methodologically and formally this work has significance in a range of practical and theoretical fields. But the work’s concentration on the meaning of ‘public’ and ‘private’ in the perpetually-regenerating city mean that it has a unique focus, with relevance especially through its screenings outside Ireland. Following its initial exhibition in Belfast, the film has been exhibited at the Museo Chiado, Lisbon, and at the BLIND SPOT film festival in Skopje, Macedonia.

10007807,36,,1231131,Q,Irish Lights film,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"Irish Lights (2009) is a16mm film digitally transferred, with stereo soundtrack, voice-over, specially commissioned musical score, and location sound. It was written, directed, filmed and edited by Daniel Jewesbury. It is an experimental exploration of ideas of sameness and difference, self and other; it is also an attempt to think these concepts differently through film, and to think film differently, to find a mode of filmmaking through which to undertake rigorous philosophical enquiry. It continues earlier experiments into filmic narrative and film form, to arrive at new ways of considering nationality and community in the context of the European project. 

The film explores certain questions within philosophy (concerning thinking for, and of, the ‘other’ as raised in works by Levinas, Ricoeur, Derrida and Rancière). Rather than merely restating or illustrating these concepts, it attempts to define a position of its own regarding knowability and otherness. It employs an idea of total form (partly derived from ideas in Lukács’ 'Ästhetik' [1963] and Jameson’s 'Marxism and Form' [1972]) in which the grammar of film (narrative, space and time) and its mechanics and technics (scriptwriting, shot planning, direction, editing and sound design) are considered in the round. Each stage or process becomes a further opportunity for reflexivity, a means by which to interrogate prior theses and demonstrate an expanded ‘mode of understanding’. The very particular combination of spoken word, visual-image-in-time and musical soundtrack aims to create a whole in which each of these elements becomes transformed by each other. Thus the film adopts a ‘twin track’, seeking to innovate the form through which its findings can be discerned and elaborated.

This film, commissioned by Project Arts Centre, Dublin, and shown at Belfast Exposed Gallery and in the Gothenburg Film Festival, is now in the Collection of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.

10007807,36,,1294049,Q,Surrender: The London Street Exhibition,,,,,,,,,,,,2008,,,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"This is a video installation for the 'London St Exhibition' held in the Context Gallery, Derry in 2008, where it was projected onto one full wall of the gallery. London Street is an old street in the historic centre of the city which, in its very name, symbolises the divided history of Derry-Londonderry. ‘SURRENDER’ is a collaborative process between Anne Crilly and Vincent O’Callaghan which explores visually the gaps and historical omissions in the received history. Crilly researched the history of London Street through testimonies of past and present dwellers, newspaper archives, and research interviews with local historians. The research question was how to find a way of telling a hidden history of a contested geographic space that would open up new insights and challenge old prejudices.
The video attempts to construct a feminist historical documentary with a less conventional narrative structure adopting a more experimental and fluid visual style. The film hints at fragments of history and of lost whispers and this suggested an impressionistic style of filming and editing. In particular, the video uses extreme close-ups that attempt to challenge the viewer to make sense of the context - to reconstruct the history as they construct the narrative.
There are shots looking in and also out of windows and doors; looking up to the Cathedral and down to the cellar; through cracks in walls and onto convent stained glass and holy statues. The film explores an 'impressionistic montage': a resident washes her steps – washing away history, memories - or perhaps the night before;
car lights, footsteps, a shocking red umbrella all jar as the present cityscape interjects into the narrative; a close-up landscape of crumpled bed sheets suggests desire, power, patriarchy. The final image is of a young woman - confident,  poised, surrendering to her own pleasure, perhaps re-writing the narrative of the space, perhaps no longer hidden from history.

10007807,36,,1404902,Q,The Maidens' City Project,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,,0,False,,False,False,,,,,,False,"The script of 'The Maidens' City' was researched, written and delivered as a guided walking tour of the Derry walls by Anne Crilly. At least 12 different tours of Derry are offered but no narrative or acknowledgement of women’s history has ever been presented. This project offers just such a gendered narrative and attempts to do so in a novel way. The script is written for three actresses who take on multiple roles. The central character is Margaret Cousins, a suffragette who leads the dramatized walking tour and interacts with other historical, contemporary or imagined characters. This is a site-specific piece of theatre for the Walls of Derry and explores the relationship between the performance and this contested cultural space with its centuries of accumulated meanings.
The video, also directed and produced by Anne Crilly, documents the dramatized tour. It was filmed twice on one day with two crews and for the most part in a 'vérité' style to give the viewer the sense of being part of the tour, walking alongside the tour guide from location to location. The 2nd cameras were mainly used to take establishing shots of the tour audience from various vantage points along the Walls and this helped illustrate the site-specific nature of the drama. They also filmed the dramatic episodes from different angles, took close-ups of audience reaction and some cutaways of, for example, the Bogside and shots of the wall murals. This observational and participatory filming style meant that the editing was itself a complicated task, matching different angles of the interactive episodes. The research questions posed by a site-specific drama were substantial and the resulting novel mix of dramatised walking tour, historical recreation, documentary observation and location shooting establishes the process of re-imagining and re-inscribing of the city space that is so much a part of post-conflict Derry.

·         How can game structures and ‘gamefullness’ be used to promote regional tourism?
·         Can game structures be used to aggregate assets for a company?
·         Can games as a Social Technology be used to question or to foster civic pride in a region?
 
This research was commissioned by the Northern Irish Tourist Board from earlier exploratory projects into behaviour and gaming. It innovated particularly by running as a photography and location-based game for 6 weeks during May 2013 and further developed into a new iteration for August 2013. 
MYNI experiments with looser play and game structures than those normally associated with the ""gameification"" approach (which maps game systems onto pre-defined desired outcomes). By experimenting with play features - feedback through scoreboards, setting objectives to overcome and missions to complete - the research investigates new approaches to engaging audiences. The project, in other words, uses methods rooted in game studies to help crowd source information, assets and publicity. In particular, it explores how games can be utilised to help engage the public in reinterpreting and re-imagining geographic and tourist spaces in Northern Ireland and offers an alternative to traditional top-down re-branding exercises.
The project asked players to complete tasks locked to regional locations and submit documentary evidence of their achievements. The results are evidenced through a series of reports recording traffic, reach, user numbers and company impact studies.
Due to its success this research is currently developing into a permanent initiative for the Tourist Board to help them engage new audiences, help to develop internal tourism in the region and aggregate publicity materials for their company. The project is planned to run in a monthly cycle for discovernorthernireland.com
