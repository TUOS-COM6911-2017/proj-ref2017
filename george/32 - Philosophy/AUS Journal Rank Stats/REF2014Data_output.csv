It counters the widespread view that Kant argues for a strict dichotomy between the rationality of humans and the causal determination of nature. Instead, it is argued that on Kant's account both a causal-mechanistic and a teleological perspective are necessary for understanding nature, and that the teleological perspective is based on an analogy with the end-directed and unifying activity of human reason. Kant's natural philosophy thus construed has important implications for contemporary debates in philosophy of biology and environmental philosophy.",,,,False,

Around 217,000 words long and equipped with a notably comprehensive bibliography, it took ten years to write and is the fullest treatment that the unity problem has ever received. Historically, the focus is mainly on the role that the problem played in early analytic philosophy, but ancient, medieval, and early modern antecedents of these discussions are also amply covered. Systematically, the book argues for the original thesis that Bradley's regress, rather than being vicious, is actually the key to what unifies the proposition.

This required a lengthy research period between 2007 and 2012 to reconstruct in detail the Kantian symbol of the Critique of Judgment, Goethe’s philosophy of the symbol and also Schelling’s Identitätssystem (which had not received substantive critical attention since the 1970s).

While acknowledging its many virtues, the essay rejects Brisson’s understanding of the text’s focus and purpose. Brisson’s methodological assumptions are especially discussed and proven to be highly questionable on account of a rather straightforward transfer of the doxographical concerns which Plato is supposed to share with contemporary historians of Parmenides’ philosophy.

The way they dealt with the argument is a fair illustration of how they were both faithful to the text and innovative in their understanding of its most challenging issues. Besides providing a detailed survey of all manuscript sources, the introductory essay shows that Latin interpretation originates from a mistake in Boethius’ translation which radically transformed the argument. The edition makes available for the first time a considerable amount of new documentary evidence which made it possible to solve the riddle of the Latin « Third Man ». "

A series of readings of Kantian aesthetics, Hegelianism and hermeneutics are then deployed to ground the culminating argument that sport is to be understood as a phenomenon akin to modernist art, requiring interpretation in order to explicate its philosophical content.",,,,,False,
